		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">What happens when your application software change cycle time shrinks from months to hours or days? Over the past four years, we have overseen the deployment of hundreds of Web business applications all following agile methods. During the course of these projects, we have faced many challenges and found some surprising benefits.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">This article describes some of the lessons we have learned and provides advice on how you might overcome some key challenges in your own agile projects.<!--more--></p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">Introduction</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">In 2001 when I assembled a team of seasoned Web professionals, we looked back at our frustrated past of trying to release complex Web applications in Extranet and Intranet environments. While we were always able to deliver these projects, the process was painful.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The review of our past performance showed that it was impossible to accurately analyze and document the real business requirements.Following a traditional waterfall method meant that projects were doomed to be late and over budget. We were plagued by changing requirements, unanticipated integration challenges, usability annoyances and ultimately the formidable task of training thousands of users in a short amount of time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">So we decided to look at the problem from a radically different point of view where we embrace and nourish change. Fundamental to this shift were two key project assumptions:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px;">1) Assume that the application scope can never be accurately defined.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px;">2) Let the application scope evolve during the project based on user feedback.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Agile methods align nicely with this approach. When complemented with tools that allowed us to time-compress the change and upgrade processes, we were on our way to dramatically improving our ability to deliver complex Web business applications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Fast forward to 2008 and 500+ projects later. Today, we have successfully adopted an extreme change mantra where we constantly enhance and re-factor applications as we drive toward meeting the real business requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">Agile - A Mantra for Extreme Change</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Our mantra of extreme change is well served by agile methods. Over the years we have found that embracing extreme change has helped us meet our project milestones and deliver applications that are aligned with business needs and easily rolled out to large user bases. We have also found that business users actually make pretty good testers and that incorporating them into the process early and often results in a better end product.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">On the flip side we have faced several unforeseen challenges. Collecting feedback from end users early and often resulted in a need to find a better way to manage and prioritize the feedback. In particular, help desks and documentation present a big challenge with embracing extreme change and must be addressed up front or you will suffer when you roll-out your application.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Over time, we've developed a tried-and-true Agile approach to help overcome these challenges and continue to work on improving our agile skills and ability to deliver dynamic applications that support extreme change.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Let's look at some of the lessons we have learned.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Listen to Users at Large</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Over time, we formalized our mantra of extreme change around an agile method and delivery platform based on Scrum. In the process, we learned how difficult it is to capture timely feedback from a large user base through the help desk and one-to-one conversations.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">About two years ago, we started experimenting with embedding feedback functionality in the applications themselves. We added a non-intrusive hovering button to the bottom of every application page that can be clicked to expand into a feedback form. The user points to the relevant area of the page, types the feedback and submits it. The page contents, user name and session information are collected automatically, packaged into a Change Request and, sent to the agile delivery team. The results have been staggering. In one case where an application was launched to 25 users, we collected more than 200 suggestions, bugs and comments in two days. Out of this 200+, 10 were identified as critical by the agile team (IT and the business) and they were implemented in three days. This tuning process skyrocketed adoption of the application and allowed a smooth roll-out for the remaining 1,100 users.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Transform Business Users into Testers</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">One of the great side benefits of having your users so heavily involved is that they make excellent testers. That is why we make efforts to get more business users participating in the early betas delivered at the end of each sprint. Taking this approach we can spot usability inefficiencies, functional errors and optimize the experience for first time users early in the process. The end result is that final acceptance testing and QA sign-off is simplified because we eliminate the delivery bottle neck.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Prepare for Life after the "Go Live"</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Rapidly responding to change is especially valuable in those days after launch where the business users get to use the application and experience the harsh reality of a new way of working. It is important that the project team stay around so they can quickly tune any remaining usability and performance issues. That is why we have restructured our typical project schedule to include a Tuning sprint <em>after</em> the application has been rolled out into production.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The impact on the team is substantial. First, you need to prepare the Product Owners and Business Stakeholders for the influx of post-launch work resulting from business user's first impressions and feedback. This feedback is valuable because it helps increase the usability of the application and decrease the need for a help desk or user manuals. But it requires an extra effort managing a growing backlog, prioritizing features and approving changes.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Secondly, the handover from development teams to maintenance teams needs to happen later on in the application life cycle. Therefore, it is always a good idea to keep the development team in place after the production release to take care of the Tuning sprint.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Manage the Help Desk Challenge</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Our extreme change mantra usually extends throughout the life of the application. After the Tuning sprint, the application typically decreases its level of critical change and is then passed over to maintenance teams. Agile maintenance teams keep a steady, continuous release cycle, launching new features every two to four weeks. This short release cycle requires constant retraining of the help desk which is simply not cost effective.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">One solution is to release less frequently. In fact, some of our customers have <em>artificially</em> slowed the release cycle for application updates to accommodate the learning curve of the help desk. However, this becomes problematic as the business quickly learns you can now make changes very rapidly as experienced during the Tuning phase of the project. Thus slowing down the release process in maintenance mode requires resetting expectations with the business.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">We have found that a better solution--especially effective for Intranet applications--is to spread the help desk function among the business user community. In a specific situation, one of our customers launched a Requisitions Management application to 1,400 employees, most of whom were first time browser users. To distribute the help desk load, they used 45 departmental administrative assistants as first points of contact. The agile delivery and maintenance teams then focused on keeping this smaller number of power users in sync with the new releases.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">You might wonder why we did not simply incorporate the help desk team into the delivery process in order to train them all at once. Our experience has taught us to look at the problem in a different way. Because of the large amount of applications supported by this staff, they had no specific domain expertise, and that prohibited them from efficiently participating in the delivery phase.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Dispense with Useless User Manuals</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">If you think maintaining a help desk is difficult, keeping a standard user manual in sync with a continuously changing application is tougher. Here the best solution has been to embed contextual "Help" into the application itself. This way, changes in the application and in the Help or instructional content are always incremental, keeping everything in sync. We have found that a content management framework embedded within the application simplifies this process of delivering user documentation in sync with each new code base.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">In traditional development projects the user documentation task can, and often is, performed fairly independently of the development work. Since in agile projects the scope evolves at each sprint, documentation and development teams must work side by side and contribute to each new release. Expect a substantial impact in your delivery, maintenance and documentation teams as you shift into an agile way of working.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">React Fast to Increase User Adoption</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Assuming change as part of the software delivery process is crucial to Agile delivery. In addition, we have found that this approach also dramatically increases the adoption of our applications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Let me give you an example. In a recent project, we had to implement a Web-based invoice approval system that would replace a complex set of manual processes. A particular sub-process involved the final invoice approval by cost center directors. In the manual process, the director's personal assistants (PAs) brought them an explanation of the invoice with an approval form ready for signature.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The new Web invoice approval system involved a "small" re-engineering of the process that assumed a pure self-service model without PA intervention. (Note: all of the cost center directors were part of the steering committee that helped define and approved this innocuous process change.) However, during roll-out we realized that half the directors had shared their passwords with their PAs, so they could do the pre-validation. Suddenly we had administrative assistants with $100,000 approval power.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">As you might guess, the capacity to change fast was crucial here. A new PA profile was added to the application, the work flow was changed to include the pre-validation process, and most importantly the PAs provided input on requirements. During the original analysis, the PAs were not even considered as stakeholders.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">This change was implemented over a couple of days driving end user adoption and making IT a hero!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">During the project postmortem, we met with the consultants responsible for the initial requirements analysis to figure out why they did not foresee this problem. In addition, we wanted to understand why the cost center directors signed off on the process design. We discovered that the directors were embarrassed to state they relied so heavily on their assistants so they approved the process change hoping it would work.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">When it comes to predefined business requirements, adopting an extreme change mantra can help you overcome poor requirements, "wishful thinking" and re-engineering challenges. We have dozens of these stories that reinforce the need for continuous change, even after the application has gone into production.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000; margin-top: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.563em;">Conclusion</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">By far, the greatest benefit of pursuing our mantra of extreme change is delivering what the business needs, on time and on budget, both predictably and well. When a company is able to react quickly to unforeseen situations, and overcome them successfully in a rapid manner, there is a direct correlation with user satisfaction--adoption simply increases and IT regains its rightful place, aligned with the business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">With over 500 successful Agile projects under our belt, one of the key learning points we want to share in this edition of About Agility is the concept of the 'Tuning Sprint'.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Over the last several years we have used this concept and found that it dramatically drives end-user adoption of the delivered application.
However, there are some fundamental challenges that we will discuss in this article so that you too can be successful.</p>
<!--more-->
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">The 'Tuning Sprint' Defined</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The concept of the Tuning Sprint is straight forward and is now part of our formal Agile Method. With each project we now incorporate a post-production sprint that is specifically for the purpose of 'Tuning'. During this sprint we are looking for two distinct types of feedback: usability of the application and performance.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">To accomplish the tuning we take the production application and share it with an expanded set of users. In most cases the new application is rolled out on a limited basis to a set of users who will ultimately become trainers and take the application to the rest of the user base. With this set of expanded users we collect feedback in as close to real time as possible, prioritize it and make the necessary changes. In many cases we deliver multiple versions to production in a single day.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The result is that many of the small, nagging usability issues are removed from the application. By addressing these issues on a daily basis during the sprint, the expanded set of end-users become owners of the new application and major proponents of the application's adoption among the full user community.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">Simple Concept - Challenging Practices</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">While the concept of the 'Tuning Sprint' is simple there are a few challenges that your team will have to overcome in order to be successful:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Challenge 1: </strong>Ability to collect and prioritize feedback in real-time</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Challenge 2: </strong>Ability to make changes rapidly</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Let's look at each of these issues in more detail and make sure we fully understand what must be overcome in order to be successful.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Challenge 1: Collecting &amp; Prioritizing Feedback in Real Time</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">While this might sound simple, for many projects this will become a big challenge quickly. First, you need to consider the proximity of your expanded user base. In many cases the users of the application will be in remote locations. Therefore you will need to have some mechanism for collecting feedback in as close to real time as possible. In the worst case you need to collect feedback a couple of times a day from these users.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Once you have the mechanism established for collecting feedback, you then need to be able to review, prioritize and easily hand it over to the development team so they can make the necessary changes. Our experience shows that when done correctly, you will receive a large amount of feedback in the first few days of the tuning sprint. We have found that if you have good tools with which to review the feedback, you will find that many of the usability issues are identified by a majority of the users and this in turn makes prioritization easy. In this case, the more users who complain about a specific issue, the more important it is to fix.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">In summary the challenge is to come up with a mechanism that allows you to easily capture the end-users feedback with as little ambiguity as possible, and make it easy to review, group and prioritize into change requests.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: black; font-weight: bold;">Challenge 2: Making Rapid Changes</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Of course the mantra of Agile is all about embracing change. However, during a Tuning Sprint we push this to the extreme. To be successful you need to address several potential development and delivery hurdles.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">First, you need to make sure that your development environment supports making rapid change in a high quality manner. In most cases these changes are not complex but when you are making the number of changes we see on a daily basis, your tools must provide excellent support for ensuring you don't create more work by breaking something that was working well.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Second, you need to make sure that you have the ability to deliver new production builds multiple times in a single day. For most, this is where quality issues really rear their ugly heads, as builds tend to be complex and error prone.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">And third, you must have the operational support to deliver these new production versions in a rapid manner. This typically means that traditional processes must be modified to support the Tuning Sprint and Operations must have the confidence in the builds to move them to production. In addition, a fool proof roll-back capability must exist if something moves to production which causes problems.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">We have found that for most of our customers, making the application change is the easy part. The challenge is executing the rapid builds while not compromising quality and getting Operations to allow you to make multiple production releases in one day.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">OutSystems Agile Products to the Rescue!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">As you might know or have surmised, at OutSystems, we have addressed the challenges associated with the Tuning Sprint.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">To overcome the challenge of collecting and prioritizing feedback, we've created the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/ECT-Demo"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embedded Change Technology (ECT)</span></a>. This allows end-users to record their feedback directly on the running application in real time. By capturing the actual screen and associated feedback, ambiguity is eliminated.
ECT is complemented by the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/Agile-Network"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agile Network</span></a> Projects. Agile Network Projects allows you to automatically collect the ECT feedback, easily group similar change requests and prioritize them into new work items for the development team. Once handed to the developer, a single click will open the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/Agile-Platform"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agile Platform</span> </a>to the spot where the change is needed.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Overcoming the challenges of making rapid change is also supported by the Agile Platform. Key functionality like our True Change™ engine assures that you don't break something that was already working. Once the change is made, we automatically merge the change and create a new deployment package - and thereby overcome the challenges faced with traditional build mechanisms. Once the build is complete, we offer Operations the ability to easily manage production versions and deploy them with a single click. If there is a problem with the new version, Operations has access to the Agile Platform's One Click Roll-back functionality which makes it easy to revert to a prior version.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">By incorporating a Tuning Sprint into your Agile projects we are confident that your end-user adoption will sky rocket and help drive Agile practices across your organization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Salim, you should include the tuning sprint in your methodology, in a way that you present it to the customer as part of the agile process. In many situations, customers are not 100% familiar with the agile methodology, so you will need to educate them on how it works. In this case it's relatively easy to explain that they need a tuning sprint and the benefits they'll get from it.
For applications that are used by a large number of users, the tuning sprint makes even more sense: as you roll-out the app to a larger group of people, you'll receive a lot of feedback on how they actually want to use it, and the tuning spring ensures you have the time to implement the necessary changes to ensure adoption.
If the group of users is really large, then you might consider some sort of phased roll-out, and eventually plan for some additional tuning sprints. You can look at these sprints as smaller version releases of the final application. At the end of each sprint you'll have an app that includes the feedback gathered from the new user group.
Hope this helps!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Salim,
a couple of caveats:
1. The tuning sprint done right generates a tremendous amount of feedback. You should select the 20 top changes that increase user adoption (usually usability or performance enhancements) and focus on those.
2. You need to make sure that your development, staging and deployment infrastructures allows for you to make changes fast and robustly. We rely a lot on the Agile Platform to be able to support many production upgrades in the 2 weeks that take the tuning sprint.
Hope this helps,
Paulo Rosado

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 0pt;  margin-bottom: 1em;">Evergreen applications are business applications that continue to evolve as the business changes and therefore provide constant value year after year.<!--more--> At OutSystems, virtually any solution that is deployed using Agile methodologies is required to stay evergreen and subject to a continuous Agile Evolutionary Maintenance process. Part 1 of this article explores the main phases of Agile Evolutionary Maintenance while <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/03/evergreen-applications-part-2---increasing-application-roi-through-evolutionary-maintenance-using-ag.html">Part 2</a> identifies some key technology challenges you must overcome to deliver on the promise of Evergreen Applications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">Setting the Stage</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Once your application goes live, it immediately enters the Agile Evolutionary Maintenance phase and will stay in this phase in order to keep up with changing business needs and to address application inefficiencies that are only identified with "real life" demand and conditions. To successfully deliver on this concept, the Agile Maintenance team schedules regular sprint releases focused on delivering the "next most valuable features" for the business.</p>
Through this sequence of regular Evolutionary Maintenance releases, the application will keep up with business needs while minimizing the impact of change on the business. The underlying principle is the same as for general Agile development - fast deployment of the most valuable features, delivered on time and aligned with the business.
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">The Agile Evolutionary Maintenance Cycle</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The Agile Evolutionary Maintenance process is a continuous cycle of application releases. Each cycle includes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Gather defects, user feedback and new business needs </strong>for the live application. This step is actually
a continuous process that normally occurs in parallel with the applications' release process;</li>
	<li><strong>Classify and prioritize </strong>all the feedback collected;</li>
	<li><strong>Convert the classified feedback into project backlog items</strong>,<strong> </strong>agreeing on the next release content.
The focus should be on the most critical defects and highest value change requests;</li>
	<li><strong> Develop and deploy the Backlog </strong>agreed for the next release.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center;"><img alt="OutSystems - Agile-Evolutionary-Maintenance using Agile-Methodologies" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ResourceNameAgileEvolutionaryMaintenance2.png" /></p>
&nbsp;

Evolutionary Maintenance releases depend on the volume and type of change required. In my experience these releases fall into one of the following three categories:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hot Fixes </strong>- quick intervention required to fix a critical defect that is dramatically affecting business operation, and deploy it immediately. These interventions are required to be completed in less than 24 hours and in some cases during the next couple of business hours.</li>
	<li><strong>Sprint Releases </strong>- made up of one sprint, lasting one or two weeks. In Agile Evolutionary Maintenance it's common to set regular short releases to keep answering accumulated user feedback and correct non critical defects.</li>
	<li><strong>Evolutionary Projects </strong>- When there is a more substantial business change, then a specific evolutionary maintenance cycle may be extended to a small/medium project with several 2 week sprints. This is a common approach to deploy a very large application: incrementally release extra functionality that has not made it into the initial agile project. Experience has proven time and time again that waiting for the perfect and complete solution leads to a less than expected return on investment due to constant changes in business scope and delayed benefit from the new application features.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The Agile Evolutionary Maintenance cycle is critical to keeping your applications evergreen. Following this approach will dramatically improve overall return on investment over the life of your application.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">In <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/03/evergreen-applications-part-2---increasing-application-roi-through-evolutionary-maintenance-using-ag.html">Part 2 of this article</a> I will identify some key technology challenges and how you can overcome them to deliver on the promise of evergreen applications.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Evergreen applications are business applications that continue to evolve as the business changes and so provide constant value, year after year. At OutSystems virtually any solution that is deployed using Agile methods is required to stay evergreen and subject to a continuous Agile Evolutionary Maintenance process. <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/02/evergreen-applications-part-1---increasing-application-roi-through-evolutionary-maintenance-using-ag.html">Part 1 of this article</a> explored the main phases of the Agile Evolutionary Maintenance process and defined the three key project types that are most common.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt;  margin-bottom: 1em;">In Part 2, I will shift my attention to defining the different types of backlog items that typically make up an evolutionary maintenance sprint. In addition, I will define some key technology challenges you must overcome in order to deliver on the promise of evergreen applications. Finally, I will describe how OutSystems can help in this process.<!--more--></p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 0.563em; color: #cc0000;">Backlog Items of Evolutionary Maintenance</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">The typical backlog items that are part of an evolutionary maintenance release include:</p>

<ol style="">
	<li><strong>Defects</strong> - fixes to application defects and business processes that are not correct for real life conditions, and therefore impact daily business operations;</li>
	<li><strong>Application inefficiencies </strong>- over time, applications composed of multiple services will experiences changes in performance profiles due to changing business use and shifting service load. It's key to identify and overcome performance inefficiencies such as:
<ul>
	<li>Slow Web pages;</li>
	<li>Slow database access;</li>
	<li>Integration bottlenecks in distributed services architecture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Usability improvements </strong>- overcome annoyances that impact user efficiency or adoption;</li>
	<li><strong>Change Management</strong> - Incrementally deliver new valuable features. Either selected from ones left out of previous releases or newly identified during the use of the live application.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Challenges of Implementing Agile Evolutionary Maintenance</strong></span>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">To achieve an effective Evolutionary Maintenance process it is imperative that the maintenance team has the right tools. They need access to development and project management tools which:</p>

<ul style="">
	<li>Allow them to assess application performance;</li>
	<li>Assist with capture and prioritization of change requests;</li>
	<li>Streamline the change, test and deployment process.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Without the proper application delivery and management environment your maintenance teams will not be able to deliver the agility needed to keep your applications evergreen. Let's explore these key challenges in a little more detail:</p>

<ul style="">
	<li><strong style="">Automated instrumentation of the application that doesn't require expensive operational support, extra coding, etc.</strong><span style=""> This is important in order to understand where to invest in code optimization when dealing with application performance issues. Areas on which to focus attention:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Identification of the application web pages visited, their rendering time and isolation of slow screens that should be reengineered;</li>
	<li>Identification of slow queries that may require optimization;</li>
	<li>Performance assessment of the web services and APIs being used by the application to provide access to external systems;</li>
	<li>Review of application error logs;</li>
	<li>Centralized analysis of all application feedback including performance logs, audit logs, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Enhanced capabilities for end-user collaboration to gather feedback on application usage. </strong>This capability is critical in order to address incorrect application behavior and improve usability and adoption. Areas on which to focus attention:
<ul>
	<li>Provide the end-user with the means to give feedback on the application behavior. This process should be intuitive for users and result in unambiguous feedback for the maintenance team;</li>
	<li>Streamline feedback management to effectively classify, prioritize and transform the user feedback into manageable backlog items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The availability of enabling technology which supports rapid change and boosts delivery efficiency. </strong>Areas on which to focus attention:
<ul>
	<li>Provide adequate application documentation when planning for evergreen applications. This is because the person performing maintenance tasks is typically not the same as the one who developed the original application; therefore it is critically important that the application's structure and logic is easy to understand;</li>
	<li>The development tools must make it easy to respond to change by supporting the change process. In our experience this includes tools that automate impact analysis and isolate change , which in turn, minimize testing and improve overall development team productivity;</li>
	<li>The application configuration and build environment must be automated to remove errors and support a rapid deployment of changes to test/production environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>How OutSystems Helps with Going Evergreen</strong></span>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/Agile-Platform">OutSystems' Agile Platform</a> and project management tools provide the technology needed to shorten delivery cycles, increase software development agility, project predictability, responsiveness to business change and overall development productivity. For Evolutionary Maintenance teams, OutSystems technology addresses the key challenges faced by maintenance teams when going Evergreen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Agile Platform automates the logic required to collect performance data and audit information. In addition, it supports the automatic logging required to address performance tuning, including monitoring third party integration done via the platforms Integration Studio toolkit;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Agile Platform's Service Center tool provides the necessary functionality to analyze performance data and audit logs collected from the application during run-time;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/ECT-Demo">Embedded Change Technology (ECT)</a> and the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/Agile-Network">Agile Network's</a> Issue Management tool ensure end-user collaboration :
<ul>
	<li>ECT provides an easy way to collect application feedback from testers, end users, etc. ECT provides meaningful information based on feedback directly from the application screen, and all feedback is automatically registered and stored in the Issues Management tool for the project;</li>
	<li>The Issue Management tool handles end-to-end issue management, from capturing user feedback, to issue classification and prioritization.Issues can then be included in the maintenance release backlog for delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Agile Platform's TrueChange™ engine supports automated impact analysis and self-healing. This streamlines the change process and assures that quality applications are delivered. Self-healing is unique to the Agile Platform and is made possible by the fact that development is done in a model-based environment. This allows the platform to understand and manage all changes across all the development artifacts. For example, a simple change request to "add a new field to a Web page form that is only visible to a Sales Manager" might require changes to the User Interface, Data Model, external Service APIs, Access Control rules and Business Rules. With its full reference checking and self-healing capabilities, TrueChange™ safely rebuilds the sections of the application that can be automatically inferred, and provides the Business Developer with impact analysis on any manual changes he or she may still need to make to fully address the requirement;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Agile Platform's 1-Click Publishing streamlines the configuration management, build and deployment process - effectively reducing common build errors and the typical build and deploy time to minutes.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">An Evolutionary approach to Maintenance is key to keeping your applications evergreen and delivering the best business ROI. As you expand your teams' Agile processes, you can apply the Evolutionary Maintenance phases defined in <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/02/evergreen-applications-part-1---increasing-application-roi-through-evolutionary-maintenance-using-ag.html">Part 1 of this article</a> across a variety of different project types and architectures. To be successful you will need to overcome the technology challenges described in Part 2.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 1em;">Be sure to review how OutSystems can help for your web business applications!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the OutSystems About Agility blog!

We decided that a good launch point for this blog would be our Annual User Group conference, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep"><b>next</b>step'09</a>, where we are bringing together Agile practitioners from across the globe to discuss all things Agile.

This year's event is taking place on <b>April 15 and 16 in Lisbon </b>- and since the economy has curtailed many people's travel plans, we want to keep everyone up-to-date on the conference proceedings no matter where they are in the world.

With over 300 attendees already registered, this Agile event is shaping up to be a cracker!<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" alt="nextstepPANORAMICA.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/nextstepPANORAMICA-thumb-600x123-82.jpg" width="600" height="123" />

The conference will be a unique opportunity to learn about Agile in practice - tools, techniques, best practices, case studies and the latest in Agile technology. <b>We will be blogging in real-time from the keynotes and all the tracks and sessions which are being presented by customers, partners and the OutSystems team</b>.

If you cannot attend the event, we're sorry to miss you in Sunny Lisbon, but hope that we can bring you some flavor of this year's <b>next</b>step'09 through our About Agility blog.

Let us know what you think!

Stay tuned. More soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Track 2 started with a great presentation by Pedro Gama, Account Manager of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pararede.com/">Glintt</a>. The presentation focused on how Glintt used the OutSystems platform to deliver a factoring solution to Finanfarma, a Portuguese Factoring society created by <a href="http://www.anf.pt/">ANF</a>. (If you want more information about factoring, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_%28finance%29">Wikipedia</a> is a good place to start)</p><p><br /></p> <!--more--><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="glintt.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/glintt2.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" width="520" height="250" /></span> <p>Pedro began by handing the mic to Fernando Malosso, responsible for the commercial area of Finanfarma. There's nothing better than having the client talking for you! Fernando did an introduction to the challenges and complexity of the factoring business, stating that IT agility was paramount. As Fernando put it "each case has its own nuances".</p> <p>Pedro returned to the podium and explained the major challenges Glintt faced for this project: &nbsp;</p><p></p><ul><li>Short time to market</li><li>Very dynamic and heterogeneous business model</li><li>The needed to quickly integrate with other systems</li><li>The ability to perform complex financial calculations</li></ul><p></p> <p>Glintt ended up delivering a very sophisticated solution, totally implemented in OutSystems. The numbers speak for themselves: 12 applications, over 100 web screens, more that 150 database entities, and a lot of very complex business logic was implemented to support this solution. </p> <p>According to Pedro, the project had an initial estimate of 3 years with 6 consultants, assuming the use of traditional technologies. By using the OutSystems Agile Platform, the project was done in 1 and a half years, with only 2 consultants! One key point that Pedro mention is that this was only possible because of Finanfarma's strong commitment!</p> <p>For wrap-up, Pedro Gama mentioned that the use of the OutSystems Platform simplified the implementation of the complex business logic, provided a way to quickly respond to business changes, displayed good performance when dealing with large volumes of data, and addressed continuous change in a very efficient and cost effective way.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Afonso Metello, founder and managing partner at <a href="http://www.epopeia.pt/">Epopeia</a>, kicked off his presentation by showing a video of the Report Studio, the tool that allows users to easily design their reports in the Agile Reporting Services solution.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 20px auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="epopeia.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/epopeia2.jpg" width="520" height="253" /></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Agile Reporting Services is a unified business reporting solution that covers the full report life-cycle, and it is seamlessly integrated with the OutSystems Agile Platform. This solution tackles a series of challenges other tools fail to address, in particular:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Fast change</li>
	<li>Easy to use for non-tech users</li>
	<li>Impact analysis (i.e. understand the exact consequences of publishing a report)</li>
	<li>Self heal (i.e. adapt to changes in the underlying model)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Afonso explained how the Agile Reporting Services totally integrates with the Agile Platform, enabling users to design, deliver and manage reports in a environment familiar to  OutSystems users. He also showed some screen shots of an OutSystems application that included report and charting widgets provided by Epopeia's solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During Q&amp;A, Afonso stressed that all reports are built on top of the data made available by the OutSystems platform. This means that - on top of built-to-change capabilities - the reports will also support easy staging from development to production.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Agile Reporting Services solution is about to go to beta in some selected customers, and is currently undergoing OutSystems Certification.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This morning's last presentation on track 2 was delivered by Rui Afonso, OutSystems Channel Manager at <a href="http://www.hyfas.pt/">Hyfas</a>. The presentation was about Hyfas success story at Refrige.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Refrige had a very complex material creation process, that spanned across 7 distinct departments. Communication was made by email and Infopath, and at the end of the process the IT department would copy the gathered information into SAP and BASIS. The IT department had to confirm all the data, and sometimes this resulted in having to request missing inputs from information owners.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="hyfas.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hyfas2.jpg" width="520" height="310" /></span></div>
<div>Hyfas considered both SAP and OutSystems technology to implement their solution. They picked OutSystems because it was faster (half the time of doing it in SAP, according to Rui), provided a reusable framework for future projects, and because everyone was talking about OutSystems and how good OutSystems applications worked!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rui talked a bit about how the project went and mentioned that even though the process was still under construction, using OutSystems made this a non-issue. He also pointed out that the main trouble with the project resided in the integrations with SAP, and gave the audience some very good advices for such integrations. The advices included making sure that you have an SAP expert available, checking all the SAP processes and BAPIs both inside and outside the SAP environment, and being very careful with custom SAP developments.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For wrap-up Rui showed some screen shots of the application and explained how they extended the information available in SAP to overcome some shortcomings of the old system. He also share his experiences on using <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/Solution.aspx?FolderPath=%5CRoot%5CContents%5CCorporate%5CITSolutions%5CECT">ECT</a>, and gave some highlights on how ECT improved the final product:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>End users had their requests met in hours</li>
	<li>Bug fixing was much more effective</li>
	<li>A number of issues were fixed before some users noticed the issue was there!</li>
	<li>Central change management, without having to call or email the development team</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rui then gave the mic to Sérgio Almeida, Project Manager at Refrige, for his customer testimonial. Sérgio emphasized once more that SAP expertise is paramount. He also mentioned that he was very pleased with Hyfas commitment in, not only delivering a solution, but a solution that works really well for the customer. Sérgio ended up stating that the project went really well and shared some of his experiences with an Agile project. He finished up by staying "if it's up to me, I'll continue to do projects in OutSystems".</div>

		<title>4 Trends Driving IT as a Source of Competitive Advantage</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Paulo Rosado, CEO of OutSystems, kicked off the conference with a thought provoking keynote arguing the idea that <a title="IT doesn't matter" href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/articles/matter.html" target="_blank">IT doesn't matter</a> and is just a commodity was incorrect and described how and why IT is in fact the source of competitive advantage for many leading companies. He also warned the audience that because every good idea is eventually copied -eroding any competitive advantage - continuous innovation is imperative.

<!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="paulo.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/paulo2.jpg" width="520" height="267" /></span>
He cited several interesting examples of companies using their IT systems to create distinct competitive advantage: a mass retail company using IT to develop customer intimacy; an Insurance company decentralizing 98% of its business transactions through their IT systems - resulting in fully empowered agents, and in turn attracting the best agents in the market; and he introduced Main Energie, the next keynote which we will also be blogging on...who is the epitome of a company using IT for competitive advantage.
At this point, Paulo turned to 4 industry trends which he believes will reinforce the notion of IT as a source of competitive advantage and which are key to the OutSystems go-forward vision and strategy.
I'm pretty certain this will take a white-paper to describe - but here are some highlights...

<strong>#1 - the acceleration of Agile adoption:</strong>

citing many examples of the Agile adoption ramp in the market, defining "Agile" and addressing the common "Agile is OK, but not for me" statement. An interesting discussion here on the difference between 1. software product organizations with established budgets, product managers, stable teams and planned design - who are doing well with Agile, and 2.Enterprise IT organizations with limited budgets, business users, shifting teams and unpredictable requirements. Paulo described how the OutSystems approach to Agile has been developed around the very different needs of Enterprise IT and how to make Agile practical in their environment - resulting in WTBWIWID (What The Business Wants Is What IT Delivers)
<strong></strong>

<strong>#2 - the rise of Business-savvy IT and IT-savvy Business users:</strong>

Paulo described how a new generation of tech savvy business people are now forcing IT to become more business savvy and driving a trend toward new roles in the IT App Dev world...which Agile is further consolidating. This trend is being addressed at OutSystems through the Agile Academy and Agile training &amp; certifications.

<strong>#3 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_is_Flat" target="_blank">the world is flat</a> (and getting flatter everyday)</strong>:

Paulo gave us an example of a customer who has development teams spread around the globe and looking to expand the team to the Asia. Probably a more and more common scenario. This flattening demands a different type of approach to Agile and different technology enablers. Here Paulo hinted at the Cloud and how that would figure into OutSystems' upcoming releases of its Agile Platform.

<strong>#4 - the Process-driven Enterprise</strong>:

the fourth and probably most significant trend, Paulo said is not a trend, but a reality. Enterprises have to address how business process fits into their IT strategy and he told us about how OutSystems has been working with its largest process-centric customers for the last 18 months to figure out the best way to help address process within the context of Agile. Here Paulo indicated that the upcoming releases of the Agile Platform are likely to tackle some of the key challenges of traditional BPM (i.e. big-bang approach with large upfront investments, and the disconnect between process &amp; applications which prevents rapid adaptation to change.)

There you have it - <strong>4 trends that are supporting how IT can be a source of competitive advantage</strong>...and the audience all seemed to agree with all the vigorous nodding of heads!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Agility2 - Driving Business Agility through Agile Software Delivery</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Andries Schilt, Operations Officer of <a href="http://www.mainenergie.nl/">MAIN Energie</a>, gave us an inspiring look at how their company, which started from scratch in 2003, and has gone from nothing (an old kitchen table and a second hand laptop) to an award winning, 100 Million Euro, Energy provider in the Netherlands, servicing 45,000 customers with just 30 hand-picked employees and extremely savvy use of technology!

On hearing this - you could see the audience all lean forward to learn how they had achieved these impressive results.

<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="andries.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/andries2.jpg" width="520" height="268" /></span>

Andries told us that they are one of the remaining privately held Dutch Energy companies who found a niche market - providing Energy related services to the Real Estate market in the Netherlands. This market has some specific needs which other Energy companies have not been able to address, allowing Main Energie to step in with both business and technology agility - the power of Agility<sup>2</sup>.So - how did they do this? Andries spoke about 2 key ingredients for their success:

<b>1) Business Agility </b>- where they took risks, learned from mistakes and adapted quickly to changes in the market. Having business agility in their blood means that the Main Energie team are willing to do things differently from their competition, and are constantly innovating.  "Business agility is in our DNA, otherwise we would never be able to survive."

<b>2) IT Agility</b> - Andries told the audience that Business agility is not enough because an agile business demands that its IT is also agile. IT agility for Main Energie means having a team of qualified professionals who strive to win - who have the right tools, environment, agile processes and procedures, and of course agile IT - which, in turn means fast time to market. Delivering new IT services and applications in weeks instead of months or even years. In an example he told us of a Sprint (#8) that was due out in July this year...it was to manage their energy portfolio. Due to the sudden changes in oil prices however, almost overnight, the business priorities were changed, and this became a high requirement - and moved to Sprint #3. The OutSystems &amp; Main Energie team has just completed sprint # 2! Well, Andries credited the Agile Platform, the agile OutSystems delivery team and the Main Energie business agility to the fact that this important application is now almost complete and ready for production.

The real learning to be derived from the Main Energie experience is that Business Agility combined with IT Agility is where their REAL power comes from - adding a new dimension to Agile - Agile<sup>2</sup>.

I loved this quote from Andries "If someone says that Agile is not right for my business - then they have something wrong with their business."]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Jones and Carlos Alves of OutSystems got the audience's brains thinking with a discussion on "Changing The economics of Application Development" with a set of questions:

"<em>Can a company really innovate in today's economic environment?</em>"

- they think "yes", and gave examples of how new ideas are coming up from the business, they are small but they are making a significant difference to business success - however, they may need custom built software (not packages) due to the need for speed and flexibility.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="whatrole.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/whatrole2.jpg" width="520" height="216" /></span> "<em>Is it all doom and gloom?</em>"

- the guys argued that NOW is the right time to innovate and get Agile. They challenged IT teams to be ready for whatever comes next with the economy -and suggested that the only way for the Audience and their businesses to not only survive but thrive, is to get more Agile.

"<em>WTBWITD</em>?"

- Mike joked with the audience that this wasn't really easy to pronounce and needed some marketing spin - but "What The Business Wants IT Delivers" Carlos said, is the essence of Agile which is basically "a systematic approach to accommodate innovation

"<em>What is Lean?</em>"

- the process to making sure IT delivers what the business needs - Agile is the secret to becoming Lean.

"<em>What is Agile and how is OutSystems different?</em>"

-Industry agile projects: iterative development with 4-6 week sprints, continuous business participation and deliver vertically integrated solutions at the end of each sprint.

-The OutSystems Agile Approach: able to pre-size the project with high accuracy; time-box principle, smaller up-front analysis and more prototyping; 2 week sprints that deliver vertically integrated solutions at the end of EACH DAY. Leverage SCRUM practices.

A great question came from the audience about "<em>how to become MORE agile when your team is on the other side of the world and difficult to reach"</em>- they are doing 3 month sprints...which is not Agile, its waterfall.

- Answers from the OutSystems team: The first issue is likely to be the lack of commitment from the business side to attend the regular weekly sprints. The second is that they need to have a business sponsor with authority who attends the regular sprints. Final suggestion - to ensure that an Engagement manager is local to the business-team, and that the Delivery Manager and the Engagement Manager are in constant communication.

Wrapping up, Mike and Carlos challenged the audience on "<em>What role will you play in today's economy?"</em>

- You have two choices: put your head in your hands and hope it all goes away or take the opportunity to embrace change and innovate."

Wise words that we can probably apply to all our lives in these uncertain times.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Extending Core Systems in a SOA Environment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The "Agile Delivery Experiences" track was kicked off by Rosa Mimoso, Director of Global &amp; Support Systems of Caixa Seguros.  Rosa shared how Caixa Seguros e Saude,Portugal's largest insurance group used Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and OutSystems Agile technologies to address their extremely large and complex business and technology environment (millions of customers &amp; claims, 4 companies, 5 brands and hundreds of legacy apps.)  <!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="caixaseguros.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/caixaseguros2.jpg" width="520" height="272" /></span>Rosa told the audience how they decided to break up their complex environment into 3 layers - Front-end, Services and Core Systems. They used the Agile Platform to enable their channel portals for customers and brokers. This was supported by existing services in the SOA architecture. OutSystems' Agile Platform is also exposing reusable services to other applications in their environment.

Rosa described the benefits that SOA &amp; Agile brought to Caixa Seguros e Saude:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- A single point of access for all solutions
- Formally documented services supported by WSDL
- Real time control: centralized logs &amp; reporting; performance indicators and alerts.
- Simplified management of multi-channel configurations, dynamic content and a common security model
- Faster component upgrade
- Simplified B2B Integration</p>
Rosa wrapped up her presentations with the Caixa Seguros e Saude team's 5 key findings:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.The systems in different layers need to be able to evolve at different speeds.
2.Integration needs to be independent from system evolution
3.New systems need to be introduced smoothly and without disruptions
4.This approach requires a paradigm shift in the core systems classification
5.Technology needs to allow Business and IT to be aligned.</p>

		<title>E.ON Benelux: Using Agile to Quickly Adapt to Meter Market Changes</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/eon-benelux-using-agile-to-quickly-adapt-to-meter-market-changes.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Next up at NextStep - Marteijn Mout who is the project managers of the<b> 'New meter market model' </b>at E.ON Benelux. E.ON is one of Europe's largest Energy providers with over 30 million customers in 30 countries.  E.ON Benelux has around 270,000 customers and they have been a customer of OutSystems since 2004.<!--more-->
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="eon.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/eon2.jpg" width="520" height="241" /></span>The project that Marteijn talked to us about during this session was to support the new Government regulation which demands that Suppliers will be responsible for the collection and validation of meter data of smart meters from 2009 and for traditional meters from 2010. He shared a great deal of information about how E.ON developed their solution using Agile and working with OutSystems, SAP and other partners.</div>
Describing the team's experience of using OutSystems Agile approach he told us that:
<ul>
	<li>They started with 5 iterations (sprints), with a period length of 2 weeks</li>
	<li>Sprint 6 was added to address new change requests</li>
	<li>Weekly progress reports with 2 demo's after every sprint and 2 week testing periods after demos</li>
	<li>Change Management requests were registered in OutSystems Agile Network (OAN), ECT and assumptions documented</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
Key challenges that the experienced:
<ul>
	<li>They were initially skeptical of the OutSystems size and scope estimate for the project - but happy that the results were delivered as expected.</li>
	<li>Intensive collaboration - Marteijn quipped that "I'm not sure how many emails I received from and sent to the OutSystems team - but there were a LOT. It wasn't bad - but was an indication of the degree of collaboration!"</li>
	<li>"We had some initial challenges on combining Waterfall and Agile methods - especially in planning - we were lucky that OutSystems' approach was flexible on that front, and we were able to combine planning into a single planning/test plan."</li>
	<li>The greatest issue was they found was the temptation to keep adding new requirements - and it was important to keep that reigned in where possible.</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
<b>End results of the project were a success! </b>
<ul>
	<li>The Customer Portal and underlying SMDR "engine" meet all requirements and more!</li>
	<li>OutSystems were a good sparring partner for architectural and functional matters</li>
	<li>OutSystems were flexible as promised (planning/adaptability)</li>
	<li>Communication lines efficient, effective and sound - even with a LOT of emails ;)</li>
	<li>Realistic planning/sizing and no budget overruns</li>
	<li>The Agile approach and technology is a big success factor for the project!</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
<i>How are you coping with the amount of inter-team communications that's required by Agile - what tools are you using?</i>

		<title>Dynamic Business Applications and Insurance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this NextStep session Pedro Rosa Santos who leads the consulting services team for <b>Keep it Simple</b>, an OutSystems Partner, addressed how <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,41397,00.html">Dynamic Business Applications</a> can play a big part in the Insurance industry.

Pedro described the quantum leap experienced in the Insurance industry from 2005-2008 as it tried to deal with market demand for new products, online self service, the need for real-time information exchange with agent &amp; broker channels and the drive to invest in new technology in order to reduce costs. The problem, Pedro explains, is that this has created an extremely complex IT environment for most Insurance companies around the globe - and the goal of building an infrastructure that is responsive to market needs - actually started to have the opposite result - preventing responsiveness!  <!--more-->
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="kiss.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/kiss2.jpg" width="520" height="347" /></span>To address the need for a responsive infrastructure and maintain low TCO - The Keep it Simple team are working with insurance companies to implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA) and build certain aspects of the systems as Dynamic Business Applications. They recommend to the insurance companies they work with (and which is probably applicable to the audience in other industries) the following:</div>
Pedro describes Dynamic Business Applications as applications where you can change business rules or change the front-end extremely rapidly - in a couple of hours or a couple of days. In order to move forward in this way, Pedro recommended the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>Identify a back-office dynamic business application</li>
	<li>Migrate business logic and rules that can provide functionality to other services (like portal, CRM or BI)</li>
	<li>Portals, product pricing &amp; management + claims management - adapt them to be changed easily, on a dialy basis and delivered to the end-user.</li>
	<li>Bring business process and business rules from the portal to the back-end, and make available to the portals and other apps.</li>
</ol>
"Portals should be built as Dynamic Business Apps, built with technologies like OutSystems - which can enable rapid change."

Pedro and the Keep it Simple team recommend that their customers and (probably applicable other industries)
<ul>
	<li>Improve your organization's time to market</li>
	<li>Use Agile methods get closer to end-user and address their needs</li>
	<li>Identify which components should be embracing change. You don't have to change everything all the time, but some systems need to adapt to change faster than others.</li>
	<li>Invest to consolidation of  IT IS around Dynamic Businss Applications.</li>
</ul>
<i>Have you heard of Dynamic Business Apps and Lean &amp; Agile Development - what do you think of it? Will it work for you?</i>]]></content:encoded>

<div align="left">At this year's OutSystems <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">NextStep</a> users conference we asked Agile practitioners from around the world for the one word that they felt summed up Agile. It made me wonder what the rest of the Agile community would say.<!--more--> So - here's asking:</div>
</div>
<b>What's the one word you would use to sum up the Agile approach?</b>

I will compile and re-post. Here are some to start with:

<i>Change - Flexibility - Success - Efficiency - Time-to-market - Quick - Mandatory - Build-to-change - Web 2.0 - Faster - Quick - Success...</i>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There seems to have been a burst of discussion on <i>risk </i>lately.  <a href="http://www.paulorosado.com/2009/07/risk-reward-and-agile.html">Paulo Rosado's blog</a> got me thinking on this topic and led me to the following question - Can you innovate without taking any risk?  The obvious answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Innovation is all about doing something different, better, in a way not previously thought of, etc.  In the end, innovating is always risky.  But we also know it is important and valuable.  So how do you take the plunge and innovate while minimizing risk in application development?<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="bungee-small.jpg" src="http://54.209.0.237/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bungee-small.jpg" width="200" height="251" /></span>Let's focus the discussion on building new application software in Corporate IT shops.  It has always been risky to do custom development and for the last 15 years or so we have tried to minimize the risk by purchasing packages.  The general premise is that "someone else must know how to do things better than we do so let's purchase their software."  While packages play an important role in most Enterprise application portfolios we all know that they have been more expensive and riskier than we originally thought.  Plus, the more popular the package the more bloated it has become resulting in higher costs and complex configuration efforts.

In hindsight we see that there have been companies who bucked the package trend and emerged as huge winners.  Some of the obvious ones include Amazon, eBay, ING and Google.  But I personally don't think these companies and their innovative applications align with the types of new applications being purchased or built in most Enterprise IT shops.  The applications I see most often are trying to automate some business process like customer relationship management, partner management portals, call center applications, etc.  For many, a new packaged application will suffice but we also see that in many cases a package is overkill.  So, the dilemma is how do I meet my business needs while avoiding the cost and risk associated with trying to make a package fit?  Starting to sound innovative and risky???

So how do you embrace innovation in your business when it comes to delivering these new business applications while minimizing risk?  You're reading the About Agility blog so you've probably guessed what I'm going to say...apply Agile methodology to your application development process.  How does Agile help you innovate and reduce risk?  Well, by taking an iterative approach to development and getting continuous input from the business people on the ground (whom we have found to be the source of most innovative ideas,) as you progress the application you will incorporate more innovative ideas and never get too far off track before getting a taste of reality.  In this way you will deliver a leaner solution that only delivers what the business needs and is likely to solve business problems in new and innovative ways.

So go Agile and start innovating!  Share your experiences in applying agile application development to deliver innovative applications!

		<title>A Developer Diary: Justin James on the Agile Platform Service Studio</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's no better way to try technology out than to build a real-life application with it. Taking an idea for a product and developing it is a great way to understand the value and shortcomings of any new tool.

This is exactly what Justin James decided to do with the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> and he's journaling his experience of developing his new web app, Rat Catcher, in a series of diary entries that are being published in <a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/">Tech Republic</a>. You can check out his first set of entries: <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2503">Diary #1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2533">Diary #2</a>.

The following is an excerpt from Justin's latest experience using the Agile Platform in <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2564">Diary #3</a> where he starts by saying:
<blockquote><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="developer-diary2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/developer-diary2.jpg" width="232" height="170" />"The Agile Platform is composed of four major pieces: Service Studio, Integration Studio, Service Center, and the Agile Network. I spend nearly all of my time in Service Studio, which is where the application and data modeling occur, as well as application debugging. You can also publish your application to a server from Service Studio. While Service Studio is an IDE, it uses a paradigm that is very different from any IDE that I have ever used.  The three major functions in Service Studio are data modeling, process modeling, and screen design."</blockquote>
He goes on to describe his first reactions, some of the difficulties he encountered, and how he managed to change his developer's paradigm to really make the most of the Agile Platform. Although a bit technical for some of our business minded readers, I think our developer base will find these articles very interesting.

I'll be curious to see what Justin thinks of version 5.1's new functionality (watch this space for more info on this upcoming release!) For example, the new wizards that will help build the screens from the data model even faster. Justin also hits on an advanced detail when he talks about the "late load" AJAX component, which admittedly was a bit of an odd pattern, and something our developers have fixed in 5.1.

<b>So, this goes out to all of you professional developers;</b> please share your experiences and tell other readers what you like and don't about working with the Agile Platform.  What do you think of Justin's take on the platform? Does it match your initial experiences?

		<title>From Hardcore Coding to Dragging Circles – A Scary but Fruitful Journey</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/?p=3720</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">As a software developer, you’re probably the kind of person that loves a mental challenge. You live for the feeling of coming up with that elegant algorithm, describing it to someone, and then smiling as they go silent for a while and then say admiringly “wow yeah, that can work.” You probably also enjoy that exhilarating feeling you get after a painstaking two-hour debug session, where you patiently gathered piece after piece of obscure information, looking for patterns, and finally everything clicks. Or even better, the feeling of power you get when you fix the issue with one line of code - the right line of code. It’s awesome!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Having spent most my R&amp;D career working with low-level languages like C and C++, I was resistant to Java. What do you mean, garbage collection? No man, I manage my own memory. No hidden magic for me, I like to be in control!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I was also resistant to .NET for pretty much the same reasons. I toyed a bit with managed C++ code in .NET to see if I could still get the same low-level in-control sort of feeling but it just wasn’t the same. I felt like “anyone could do this” and it wasn’t special anymore. You probably just smiled a bit because you have shared this same thought one or more times. Maybe you still do!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, I thought I would miss the technical challenge that comes with hardcore low-level coding. However, on later reflection I realized I was just worried that my hard-earned skills as a “real coder” were becoming less valuable. In fact, I feared that pretty soon everyone would be able to code and I’d become obsolete.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Before I started working with OutSystems Platform, I was still coding in C++ for a major video game company. When I was presented with the opportunity to work at OutSystems, I was exhilarated by the challenge of doing something completely different, but I was really worried about the technology. After all, my fears had come true. Here’s a technology that allows pretty much everyone to write and maintain solid applications much faster than I would ever be able to and without writing almost any code.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Not only did I feel obsolete but I also feared that I would be bored without the technological challenge of writing code, managing memory, interfacing closely with the machine - all those things that made me feel special, hardcore, an expert and a “real coder.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless, I embraced the challenge and three years down the road, oh man, I’m so glad I did it!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The biggest change for me, looking back, is the change in focus. Nowadays, most of my time I’m thinking at the business level, I’m not slowed down by technical implementation details, and came to realize just how valuable that is for business. In fact, my fear of becoming obsolete was justified, but I had it all wrong. I would have become obsolete if I hadn’t made this switch, if I had stuck with some technology just because I was good at using it, or that it’s cool, or that it gives my brain the extra challenge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I realized that my value is greater by being able to translate business requirements into working software at a pace that makes sense to business (i.e. super fast) than by simply being the guy that’s “really good at C++.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">If I can try a metaphor here, I found it’s more valuable to be the guy that knows where the nails should go than the one who’s really good at hammering them in. The day someone invents a nail gun the hammer guy is ‘screwed’, the other guy isn’t.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">And for the technical challenge, I haven’t lost it, it just changed. The challenge is no longer the technology; it’s on a higher level. Not focusing on the intricate details of an application has opened my mind to the possibilities of the higher levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t mean to make this sound abstract, but the general feeling I get when developing on the Platform is that anything is possible. Integrations are suddenly easy - almost trivial - prototyping / scaffolding is insanely simple, and getting sample data in there is a breeze. All of these things that shouldn’t consume much development effort, actually don’t.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I find myself saying “yes, of course we can do it” almost all the time, whereas before I mostly said “yes, we can do it, BUT…” and the but was anything from we need extra time to develop an integration API, setup additional working environments, learn new languages, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While all these things get me some “street cred” as a coder and beef up my resume with more tool knowledge, I would find myself less attractive to an employer if they can hire someone to do the same things I do but in one fifth of the time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">My guess is I would eventually become a niche, still providing some value but to a decreasing number of people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I still miss coding from time to time, and I tend to jump at the opportunity to create extensions in Java or C#. It’s fun to me and I think it will always be, there’s no way around that. But I still find many of the same mental challenges I know and love while dragging circles in OutSystems Service Studio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I still can’t turn off my architectural mindset. I mean, the Platform makes it easier to do things, but it can’t do the ALL the work for you. There’s still good coding and bad coding in the OutSystems world. There’s still good and bad architecture; there are still good and bad algorithms; there’s still fast code and slow code. All the differentiators and challenges are still there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Just because everyone can write a C++ class doesn’t mean that everyone does it well, and I believe the same applies to any programming technology. So don’t worry, you won’t be bored and you’ll be a more valuable resource to any company that actually cares about getting value for money.</span>

		<title>Challenges of Scoping and Sizing Agile Projects</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/challenges-of-scoping-and-sizing-agile-projects.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nuno Teles, Service Operations Director at <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/">OutSystems</a>, launched the afternoon here at track 2 by talking about the challenges of scoping and sizing an Agile project. Agile projects are not based on lengthy specifications and piles of documents. Instead, they are focused on a clear business need and on understanding and designing the simplest effective solution to address it. The challenge consists of sizing a project based on fuzzy and high level requirements.

<!--more-->

At this point Nuno did a demo of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/network/">OutSystems Agile Network</a>, where he showed an entire project scoped in the web interface. To illustrate how scoping works, Nuno added a new story and some features to the project. When it came to sizing, everyone was amazed at how easily Nuno selected key parts of the story text and turned them into planned action items.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="teles.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/teles2.jpg" width="520" height="297" /></span>

According to Nuno, OutSystems uses a long proven sizing methodology, developed, refined, and revised over 3 years and more than 400 projects. The methodology process consists of gathering requirements, organizing them into modules and drilling them down just enough to get an accurate sizing with an acceptable risk. To ensure transparency and alignment, all steps are made in close cooperation with the customer.

Nuno also added that having customer participation from day one is also a great way to ensure the Agile Methodology kicks in. The collaborative discussions during the sizing process naturally flow into backlog and sprint management performed during the project. At this point he urged the audience to try the sizing tool for themselves, by registering for a free trial of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/network/">OutSystems Agile Network</a>!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ana Paula of Whatever Consulting spoke this afternoon on <b>"OutPractices: Agile Transformations of any Software Development Process"</b>. She talked to us about a subject close to her heart - the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/">Eclipse Process Framework</a> (EPF) which aims at producing a customizable software process engineering framework, with exemplary process content and tools, supporting a broad variety of project types and development styles. <!--more-->Ana spoke in particular on how OutSystems customers can leverage the EPF library to further develop their in-house processes especially when they need to include the use of other non-OutSystems processes or methods.
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="whatever.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/whatever2.jpg" width="520" height="329" /></span>First, she described the The EPF Agile Kernel - they asked "what is the minimum aspects of a process that make a method Agile?"...and came up with the idea of a Kernel which is the smallest process that you can have. Each agile-related method was broken up into small practices (from whichever method - SCRUM, XP etc) that can then be pulled together and have been made available in the EPF library.Ana spoke about how she has documented the OutSystems processes and added them to the library - called OutPractices - within the SCRUM practice library.  Now people can learn about SCRUM with OutSystems guidance over it - which she believe to be very powerful as the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/GetResource.aspx?ResourceName=8_Agile_Stages_WhitePaper">OutSystems methods</a> and supporting technology are based on real project experience and heuristics (and not examples about playing poker).

</div>
SCRUM roles were replaced with OutSystems roles and the OutSystems lifecycle has been replicated and documented in the EPF library.

Why is this important?  Ana asked us to imagine you are in an environment where you are required use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">RUP</a> and its part of an RFP you're responding to. How will you do that as an OutSystems customer or partner?  Using the EPF library - Ana suggests that the audience can now select the Use Case practice from RUP and bring that into the OutSystems method.

Imagine you find yourself required to comply with <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/06.reports/06tr008.html">CMMI-DEV</a>. (much laughter from the audience here...small Portuguese joke that the blogger didn't understand!)  ...which is considered to be very bureaucratic and difficult to use in practice. So, what do you do? Ana suggested that you don't try and rewrite your method to fit within CMMI - but to leverage the EPF library and OutPractices - and for example, with respect to the CMMI Project Planning /Establish Estimate Practice - just select and add a link to the scoping &amp; sizing task!

"What matters isn't following a method - but to deliver. Adapt the process you are working with and improve things as you go."

<i>Can the EPF help organizations sustain and scale agile adoption?</i> Not if it is used to develop new process dinosaurs. But, it can help if it enables your team to ride the agile wave and experiment with one practice at a time.

Ana asks the audience to remember the Agile Process Development Manifesto:
<ul>
	<li>Scale small process up - over tailoring Big Processes Down. (Start small and add just what you need).</li>
	<li>Incremental practice adoption - over Full Process Adoption</li>
	<li>Continuous Improvement - over complete replacement (just improve what isn't working)</li>
	<li>Open Process Collaboration - over closed process development (tell others when you discover a better way to do things and help the whole community advance!)</li>
</ul>
This last point seems to be the real crux behind the EPF endeavors - and BTW, blog readers - if any English speakers would like to help Ana in her work to document the Agile processes - please raise your hands! :)

<i>So, here's a question for our Blog readers - If you are using the OutSystems Agile Approach have you had to incorporate other methods as Ana described - and how did it go?</i>

		<title>7 reasons NOT to use Model Driven Development</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/7-reasons-not-to-use-model-driven-development.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eric ten Harkel, founder and manager of <a href="http://www.coolprofs.nl/en/">COOLProfs</a>, started this really insightful and humorous look at some provocative reasons a company shouldn't use Model Driven Development:
<ul>
	<li>You want to hide behind technology</li>
	<li>Producing hours is all that matters</li>
	<li>Methodology over delivery</li>
	<li>Your most important goal is management attention</li>
	<li>Your marketing manager is color blind</li>
	<li>You are not in the 21st century yet</li>
	<li>High productivity is a threat<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="eric.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/eric2.jpg" width="520" height="272" /></span>

With over 23 years of model based development using Agile-like methods, Eric took a look at how the industry has evolved and outlined his thoughts on opportunties for improvement. He discussed the outsourcing movement, but stated that the value of Agile and the need for business alignment will kill this for all but the most commodity-based applications.

Eric pointed out that development takes too long and is too hard with current tools like Visual Studio. Although new tools will help the development time, he made the point that the tools in themselves are useless without proper methodology.

An answer to this was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Systems_Development_Method">DSDM</a>. This enabled doing the project in an iterative way, paving the way to Agile. Eric then talked about the psychology of Agile. He highlighted two main points that he believes make Agile successful:
<ul>
	<li>If you're worried and you share the worry, the worry decreases</li>
	<li>If you're happy and share the happiness, the happiness increases</li>
</ul>
The winning formula for Eric consists in balancing the methodology, the organization, and the tools. And Eric says that in the future COOLProfs will be using OutSystems as the<i> </i>tool!

The reasons that make Eric love OutSystems are the platform stability, the customer involvement, the ability of the platform to handle large volumes, the scrum meetings, the ability to change systems on the fly, and the amazing quality of its support.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ITIL over OutSystems - Excellence and Agility for Turismo de Portugal</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/itil-over-outsystems-excellent-and-agility-for-turismo-de-portugal.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hugo Sousa, IT Director of <a href="http://www.turismodeportugal.pt/">Turismo de Portugal</a>, started out by sharing with the audience his commitment to the business goals of Turismo de Portugal. For that, he showed us his project goals:
<ul>
	<li>Measure and get 90% satisfaction</li>
	<li>People are all that matters</li>
	<li>Do IT better</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

This is a very important change in IT, where usually the metrics are measured in bandwidth and server uptime!

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="turismo.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/turismo2.jpg" width="520" height="173" /></span>

Hugo pointed out that to do this IT Governance was a <i>must</i>. But because the rules can change and need to be adapted, Hugo stated that what he really needed was Agile IT Governance. After looking at several pre-packaged solutions, Turismo de Portugal picked OutSystems because it was the technology that could provide the necessary flexibility to implement IT rules in a simple and agile way.

By using OutSystems technology and implementing with <a href="http://www.inov.pt/">INOV</a> a centralized help desk system, Turismo de Portugal not only surpassed the 90% satisfaction mark, but was also able to gather data on the submitted incidents and have real time visibility on SLAs and satisfaction status.

Hugo highlighted 3 reasons why Turismo de Portugal picked OutSystems:
<ul>
	<li>What you need is what you get</li>
	<li>Change is the only constant</li>
	<li>Technology is not the most important thing. People are.</li>
</ul>
Turismo de Portugal plans to continue using OutSystems to expand their solution to support change management and financial management, and also other important projects not only related to Service-Desk (ITIL).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Launching a New Company in a Fast and Agile Way</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Miguel Barreto, CEO of <a href="http://www.homeenergy.pt/">Home Energy</a> spoke to us next on <i>"Launching a New Company in a Fast and Agile Way"</i> Home Energy is a new company that's part of the Martifer, a Portuguese renewable group. Home Energy was established in May 2008 with a goal of being a market leader in a new space opened up by new regulations related to Energy Certification and Microgeneration (small photovoltaic panels for home use) for the domestic housing market. January 2009 was when the market was going to take off and Home Energy needed to be ready to support a 200,000 housing market.<!--more-->
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="homeenergie.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/homeenergie2.jpg" width="520" height="324" /></span>
A little explanation: new domestic home sales require an energy certification on the Energy Class of their home and measures/recommendations that can be taken for improving energy efficiency. E.g. solar panels, window types and insulation. The Energy Class is dependent how much energy a house requires to keep it comfortable as compared to established benchmarks.</div>
The big challenge was to be ready for a January 2009 launch with a company that was started in May 2008! The Home Energy business plan and strategy relied on strong technical support and had a goal of having a live system in place by October 2008, with just 3 months for development.

Miguel described the Home Energy system where a client has to call the call center (or real estate agent partners send in clients through the website) - a team of 50 field agents/consultants are scheduled throughout Portgual to visit the client homes and assess their Energy Class. This information is uploaded to the servers and the experts at home office execute the process to establish the Energy Class - customers then pay for the assessment online, at which point the team is able to make the home's Energy Certification available.

While other potential vendors said they could not address all of Home Energy's requirements within the timeframe - the OutSystems Partner <a href="http://www.reditus.pt/">Reditus</a> proposal using the OutSystems Agile Platform was chosen because of its ability to address the aggressive timetable, develop rapidly and change while the systems was in production - as new business requirements came up.

Although Miguel was initially skeptical on the flexibility of the tool and how easy it would be to change things -he was very pleased with how it worked in practice. He felt that the multiple sprint approach enabled the business team to get a really good feel for the application as it was being developed -allowing them to make improvements while it was being built and ensure it addressed their needs.

Miguel showed a number of very cool screenshots of their complete application - including  integration with GPS systems for home location and aerial pictures of the house; the ability for consultants to draw on house maps, and assuming enough information...almost automatic generation of the certificate for the clients. Built with a team of 8 people in the first 3 months, this fully integrated system went into production on time and Miguel and team were extremely happy with the outcome.

Miguel wrapped up with a set of their key findings:
<ol>
	<li>A good RFP that focused on key user needs was critical - even though things have changed since.  Approx 70% of the original RFP was implemented - the other 30% were "wish list" items that the team realized they didn't really need...and were subsequently replaced by another 50% that came from market changes after the initial system was implemented.</li>
	<li>Short rounds (sprints) of demos with key users were extremely important, establishing a good working relationship and interactions between users and technology team.</li>
	<li>Flexible tools facilitate and enable entrepreneurial flexibility - a very important point that underlies the overall success of this case study.</li>
	<li>"Custom is better and more efficient than standard approaches" - Miguel's past experience with a packaged or standardized approach is that it became very difficult since the package too much functionality than was needed for the business users - but he felt that custom builds were possible without huge expense - even though they meant potential rough starts.</li>
	<li>The development team was dedicated to this project and their spirit and proactivity was very important for ultimate success - where they focused on the end result and drove overall success.</li>
</ol>
<i>This is the second case study where we've heard about how changes in economy or regulation open up new market opportunities - for those who are the most innovative and nimble (the other was <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/agility-squared---driving-business-agility-through-agile-software-delivery.html">Andries Schilt at Main Energie</a>) - are you seeing the same thing happen in your industry? What technologies are you using to take advantage of the opportunities?</i>

		<title>Introducing Agile: Hidden Benefits (and some challenges)</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/introducing-agile-hidden-benefits-and-some-challenges.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our next presentation was by Stefan Meier, Associate Director, Software Development, Information Sciences Department at <a href="http://www.xdx.com/">XDx</a>. Xdx is a biotech company that relies on software and technology for their Molecular Diagnostic Technology. They assess patients who have had a heart transplant and whether they are likely to accept or reject the transplant. They are also working on a clinical study to provide the data to find correlations between genetics and pathology in disease/immune system-related areas.<!--more-->
<div></div>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="xdx.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/xdx2.jpg" width="520" height="365" /></span>
<div>Prior to Agile &amp; OutSystems - the development team was 5 developers and 2 SQA and 1 project manager using classical waterfall methods - with 3 Web-based EDC systems for clinical trials, 2 internally developed LIMS applications (1 FDA regulated), several custom query/reporting/maintenance applications and Excel spreadsheets for reporting.</div>
One key problem Stefan highlighted was that each member of the development team used their own chosen environment - Java, PHP, .NET and VB! This degree of complexity and development approach caused lower levels of productivity than they would have liked - for example before OutSystems and Agile, a project that should have taken 4 months took 1 year to deliver.

With all the requirements of the business and limited ability to increase the size of the development team, the Xdx IT team decided to create a unified software architecture using SOA and deliver new applications while reducing maintenance costs and developing reusable components.

One of the missing pieces of the puzzle turned out to be OutSystems and the Agile approach. They decided to choose a platform and not the method first...(a little different to most as they did not choose the methodology first). Several reasons - including the need for a rapid development platform to keep up with the needs of their scientists. Another nice side-effect of this choice was that it meant Xdx could side-step the platform wars - and introduced a new option - OutSystems and its Agile Platform.

After 15 months and many applications built with the Agile Platform - Stefan noted were several effects:
<ul>
	<li><i>Probably the best benefit: </i>A new way to interact with the business users, because with each demo the users could SEE the app as it was being developed, even in the very early stages...and the tangible results (even after the first sprint) helped build user's confidence and adoption of the idea of Agile within the company.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><i>The biggest challenge was unanticipated: </i>resistance of the Agile Platform within the development team itself. The resistance was because of perceived platform restrictions and potential skills deterioration. Stefan said that the second issue is probably more difficult to address - and they did it by enabling the developers to move around different projects. Stefan shared that the "Platform restriction" objection often went away as the developers got hands-on with the platform, although criticism was dependent on the profile of the developer. Stefan categorized the profiles as "The Programmers" who were OK with the Platform because they could get so much more done, the "Hacker Genius" who writes entire apps with 1 line of Perl code - who are likely complain the most and may or may not ever be a convert. And, finally the "Theorist" who just thinks the very idea of using a "platform" is just wrong - they may change their mind after getting hands-on with the technology but not always.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><i>Integrating the 2-man QA team with the Dev team </i>- the QA team was classically trained on the waterfall method and FDA approval requires rigorous testing. They tried combining the 2 processes - that didn't really work. So, they tried handing over pieces of the app for testing periodically - this worked to a degree but was uncomfortable for the testers since they didn't like testing a product that was incomplete.The third try was to integrate a member of the QA team with the rest of the team from the beginning of the project and they were able to start testing in the sprints...they were then much happier since they knew about all the decisions that were made during development process. Also - the testers were able to provide important input on how to improve system testability during development. The team's next step is to introduce an automated testing tool for regression testing - making QA even happier!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><i>"Agile IS as valid a process as waterfall method in a regulated environment"</i> since documentation is being developed along with the application - however it's important to keep the documentation at the appropriate level of details (e.g. patient care require very detailed documentation). Design reviews are the other requirement - and each demo is used as a formal design review - therefore implicitly fulfilling this requirement through the development process.</li>
</ul>
After 15 months with Agile &amp; OutSystems it is now the de facto standard for building web applications at Xdx. They have built 3 apps (7 production releases) and around 5-6 reusable services. A great success so far!

They are also a step closer to having a unified software infrastructure with reusable services. They have shortened turn-around time from request to delivery - and providing high quality and high impact applications.

Last but not least - the new architecture, approach and tools have enabled consistent data across all divisions through integrated applications - a very important aspect in the clinical trial process!

<i>

Have you had any experience of combining Agile and Waterfall methods? What did you think of the XDx team's solution to the QA challenge?</i>

		<title>Adopting Usability in an Agile Environment</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/adopting-usability-in-an-agile-environment.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gem, User Experience Engineer of <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>, closed track 2 sessions by talking about how usability and agility can work well together.

Gem started by highlighting the similarities between usability and Agile, including the fact that they are iterative and that they both mean extra value for the company. But, as Gem pointed out, there are also some fundamental differences, including the fact that usability is slower than Agility and most feedback is gathered from outside the team, as opposed to coming from the team.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="gem.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/gem2.jpg" width="520" height="266" /></span>
Because of this, mixing both can be a challenge, and Gem pointed out some pitfalls that should be avoided. The main point here was that, if you try to mix the traditional way of doing usability - using an independent usability team with a long usability analysis - the usability professionals will struggle and the results will be poor. After all, by the time the usability tests are available, the Agile built application will have change to accommodate the latest user feedback!

Gem shared with the audience some practices to avoid this problem and to ensure that usability goes along with agility. These include setting usability goals per sprint, make sure feedback is gathered along with other sprint feedback, and most importantly that there is a usability expert in each team. If having a usability expert per team is not possible, select someone in the team to play the role of usability advocate.

To give an example of a project where usability and agility worked well together, Gem used OutSystems ECT. According to Gem, ECT is a great example of how usability and functionality work well together, not only providing a good user experience for the end-user, but also providing all the needed information for the agents that will deal with the feedback.

For wrap-up, Gem gave some advices to add usability to your applications. The most important one is that the developer of the application must realize he or she is not the user! Using the OutSystems style guide is also good idea to ensure usability.

Ideally this would all be followed with frequent user testing, but since having few tests is better than having no tests, Gem suggested that if all else fails, cheat! Do hallway tests, do some tests that don't require users, follow standards, and use what worked well for others!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Making Public Services Agile through Process Automation</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/04/making-public-services-agile-through-process-automation.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last session of track 1 was presented by OutSystems Partner <a href="http://www.normatica.pt/">Normatica</a>, represented by Alexandre Mano, and OutSystems Customer Dr. Marcelo Mendonça de Carvalho of <a href="http://www.seaal.gov.pt/">Gabinete do Secretário de Estado Adjunto da Administração Local</a>.

<!--more-->

Alexandre introduced the RJUE Project (Regime Jurídico da Urbanização e Edificação) and gave the floor to Dr. Marcelo de Carvalho who started his presentation by explaining the new legislation and the Simplex program that prompted the creation of the new municipal portal. The simplification of the legislation and the bet on new technologies that the Portuguese government is undertaking led DGAL - Direcção Geral das Autarquias Locais to build a Project in two phases.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="RJUE.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/RJUE2.jpg" width="520" height="370" /></span>

Dr Marcelo de Carvalho explained that the first phase of the Project, which automated the process from the perspective of the Town Halls, has been in production for some time in <a href="http://www.portalautarquico.pt/">www.portalautarquico.pt</a> and has already virtualized over 900 processes. The new phase of RJUE has just gone live and is going to automate the end-to-end process for people requesting construction permissions.

Focusing on the Agile practices, Dr Marcelo de Carvalho called the audience's attention to the importance of using sprints in order to ensure visibility over what is being delivered and adjusting the prioritization of the new features to be implemented.

Alexandre Mano closed the presentation by reiterating the importance of the OutSystems Agile Platform and Methodology in the Project and expressed his eagerness to continue to promote new projects using this approach.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Getting approval &amp; funding for Agile IT projects - do we need to change corporate culture?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During last week's <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/agile-in-a-day">Agile-in-a-Day workshop</a> in the Netherlands, I participated in an interesting discussion with the group of 25+ current and future Agile practitioners - on the impact of Agile methodologies on well established corporate processes and culture. <!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="moneybag4.JPG" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/moneybag411.jpg" width="213" height="158" /></span>
In particular, on the question of moving Corporate IT to Agile and how that means changing the traditional way that IT projects get approved and funded.  The group felt that breaking the traditional cycle of detailed requirements documents, mandatory project deliverables and change requests would impact the entire project approval/funding and management processes - and yes, successful transition to an Agile model would require corporate IT to educate their business owners and stakeholders on the Agile approach.  However, the workshop participants all agreed that making this change would definitely be a challenge.

One of the strategies we discussed was shifting the focus of the procurement process from <i>detailed requirements</i> to defining the <i>amount of functionality</i> to be delivered.  We shared the OutSystems' approach of using user stories and patterns to set a high level scope of functionality to be delivered and made the case that function points could be used as the measure of functionality - since this would allow the delivery team the necessary freedom to adjust the requirements during the project while still meeting a target deliverable.

This seems to be a recurring theme that I'm hearing from IT teams who want to embrace Agile. If you have faced this challenge and succeeded (or failed) - what do you think of the above approach and how does your IT team get its Agile projects approved and funded?

		<title>CEO&#039;s DO care about IT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://twitter.com/mkrigsman">Michael Krigsman</a> recently asked the questions "<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/projectfailures/?p=3826">Do CEO's *really* care about IT?</a>" and reviewed a panel discussion by CEO's from tech companies talking about the issues of Business-IT alignment. He says, after listening to that discussion "it appears little progress has made been in addressing this issue."

I would love to have heard the discussion between CEO's of non-tech companies to see if their views differed - my guess is if they were honest they would agree with Champy that "CEOs don't pay attention to technology unless something breaks down."<!--more-->

Having said that, I have met many progressive CEO's who realize that their business can grow and thrive as a direct result of their investment in IT.

On the issue of Business-IT alignment, this is one of the fundamental reasons why we have championed Agile as a methodology for application development. It's not just the latest trend in IT, but at its very core is about solving the issue of non-alignment and its down-sides with which we are all familiar. Agile requires massive cultural change from both Business and IT - but if embraced, we have seen HUGE changes in the value delivered by IT, the on-going relationship between Business and IT, and most importantly - tangible and repeatable value delivered to aid competitiveness and growth of businesses. The p<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">resentations by customers and partners </a>on their Agile case studies (at our recent customer conference in Lisbon) is a testament to this potential for success.

So - yes, I second Michael's call for CEO's to publicly proclaim Business-IT integration as a strategic priority - especially if they want to stay ahead of the curve!

How well aligned is your IT with the business and is IT on your CEO's radar?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Key take-aways from this year&#039;s Forrester&#039;s IT Forum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I attended <a href="http://www.forrester.com/events/eventdetail?eventID=2374">Forrester's IT Forum</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.  In looking back over my notes I wanted to share some of the highlights.  The first keynote started off with the resounding words:  "Never Waste a Good Crisis".  Bobby Cameron, Vice President, Principal Analyst, Forrester  expanded on this notion it appeared that the main point is that during a crisis change tends to be accelerated which should allow those savvy IT organizations to address these key challenges:

•    How do I get leaner and reduce IT waste?
•    How do I protect and promote innovation?
•    How do I reshape my own role?
•    How do I measure and communicate value?<!--more-->

As I listened to the discussion and many of the sessions to follow, I learned that many of the analysts and attendees were becoming aligned with the idea that an Agile approach to application development will help on many of these fronts.  First, it will help IT get leaner and reduce waste by only delivering what the business needs while helping IT with business communication or alignment.  It was also pointed out that if organizations really embrace Agile and let teams be self directed, we should even break down some of the inefficiencies of big, inflexible architecture and allow teams to select the development tools, application stacks, etc to get their jobs done quickly with minimal cost / waste.  What a novel idea!

Bobby also discussed the importance of IT leaders really paying attention to IT Value.  The key point is that value is always perceived.  Some people see value in driving a Mercedes while others see it as a waste of money.  Thus for IT professionals we must make sure that the business sees value in what we deliver.  Thus, we must become more agile and deliver on business objectives in a way that facilitates communication and measures business value - the last key challenge in the list above.  As we all know, an Agile application development approach will dramatically lead to this outcome.

I found it interesting that Forrester's analysis is showing that many traditional IT roles are being moved into the business - some of the examples given were project management and business analysis roles.

I am interested to hear if any of you are shifting some roles out of IT and into the business.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lean Agile and Fit to Purpose (more from Forrester ITF09)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was a <a href="http://www.forrester.com/events/eventdetail?eventID=2374">great session by John Rymer and Dave West</a>.  They provided some interesting stats:
•    80-90% of IT spend is on software maintenance
•    Business are demanding innovation
•    Time to market is more critical now than ever before.

These three stats should be staring you right in the face - How can you be more innovative in shorter time frames than ever when 80-90% of your budget is spent on maintenance? <!--more-->

A key message from this session is that software bloat is the biggest issue.  They pointed to five causes for software bloat:

1.    The sheer number of features we attempt to add to an application
2.    Specification and protocol stacks continue to grow
3.    Vendor consolidation leads to large suites which you have to purchase entirely
4.    Middleware continues to get more and more complex
5.    Traditional development processes lead to overly complex applications

Of course the key message is that lean software is the antidote to software bloat.  Agile methods can help us to focus on only the high priority features resulting in leaner software.  The key challenge is how to get your business to support an Agile approach and come to terms with the notion that, in many cases, it is more cost effective to not automate processes that seldom occur - they are better handled manually keeping your applications lean and focused on the key business processes.

Feel free to share examples where your business has embraced Agile and successfully de-prioritized application functionality as too low to implement.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 Areas of Caution for Corporate IT Agilists</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, SAP is embracing Agile development for their new SaaS strategy (see <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=783">Phil Wainewright's post on the recent SAP announcements</a>); About time don't you think?  Most ISVs are way ahead of the hype around Agile and have been applying some form of Agile development since the beginning of this century. Now, for those of you working in corporate IT shops who think SAP's move is a great endorsement of Agile methodology and are going to run to your management shouting "the time is now!" ...let me caution you on a few key points where you might run into some bumps.<!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="Caution-agilists-beware.gif" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Caution-agilists-beware2.gif" width="200" height="204" /></span>
<b>1. You probably don't have an ongoing product-based budget. </b>This means that you can't simply keep on developing until the customer is satisfied.  In your corporate IT world you will still have to get funding for each project, which means some form of project scoping and estimating. If this is done the way it has been in the past it will not be very Agile! Also, if you really embrace Agile, those features that get pushed out of scope by the business (due to more important features) will have to be put into another project which will require more scoping, estimating, funding and perhaps even a bid process with your third party contractors - NOT very agile.  All this can defeat the benefit of Agile and leave your business with the Agile blues. (I discussed this issue in a <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/05/getting-approval-funding-for-agile-it-projects---do-we-need-to-change-corporate-culture.html">previous About Agility Blog post</a>)

<b>2. You probably don't have a staff of full time Product Managers.</b>  Of course you don't have product managers in a corporate IT shop.  This role is supported by the business users. Thus, you have to work really hard to change corporate culture and get these business users to play in an Agile way.  This will require more of their time, more trust and a shift of application ownership during development, that for many is a real culture shock.  Be prepared.  The good news is within a few sprints you should have them on board as long as you keep your sprints short (2 weeks max) and hit your sprint demo deliverables.  Once they get a good taste of Agile they will not go back!
<b>
3. Your self-organizing team isn't so well organized. </b>The challenge many of you in the corporate IT world face is a lack of on-staff resources.  Thus, a lot of applications work is co-developed or outsourced to third parties.  This makes the concept of self organizing teams a bit risky as it introduces lots of politics, negotiations, etc.  Once again, not very Agile.  You will have to find the right contractors and get your procurement organization to let them participate in an Agile manner so they don't risk losing their shirt or end up using non-Agile practices.

So, while I am a big proponent of Agile, to be successful in the corporate IT world requires a lot of culture change!  And while SAP may go Agile in one big push, for the rest of you, I say "be Agile - take it one project at a time, think big but start small and learn with your business as you go."

Calling all corporate IT shops - have you adopted Agile practices? Have you encountered these issues? How have you dealt with them?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There seems to be a growing amount of discussion around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> approach to software development.  For those of you who, like me, had never heard of Kanban, it has its roots in <a href="http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/production_system/just.html">Japanese lean manufacturing</a> concepts.  I read a great article titled "<a href="http://agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html">Kanban Development Oversimplified</a>" by Jeff Patton.  If you are interested in the Kanban way to organize your development then give this a quick read - it is well written and starts off with a good look at the origins of the Agile methodology. <!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="postit_blog_or.gif" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/postit_blog_or2.gif" width="300" height="300" /></span>
From my perspective, having now done a little research into Kanban, the approach is very similar to something I practiced back in 2002 while looking after storage products for BMC Software.  In my opinion, Kanban is a great process for software product companies who want to drive efficiency across their product delivery process.  However, it is not ideal for corporate IT shops who are working on improving their application development processes and better alignment with the business.

Even though I'm an Agilista at heart, I believe we can learn from the Kanban approach, however, there are some things that just don't seem like a good practice.  For example:
<ul>
	<li><b>Lack of Iteration</b>: Kanban doesn't include an iterative approach - which I feel is one of the key Agile tenets that delivers real benefit.  It allows us to continuously align with the business and deliver exactly what the business wants - regardless of the set of requirements we started with.  Invaluable in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>No commitment to deliver</b>: Without iteration and time boxed sprints you never have the opportunity to set expectations and then meet them - 'deliver early and often' as we like to say.  This is critical to drive business trust and Agile adoption.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Writing Larger Stories</b>:  Kanban proposes writing larger stories around the concept of a minimal marketing feature (MMF).  Once again, a concept that makes a lot of sense for software product companies in the commercial software world.  In my experience, writing larger stories results in longer development cycles for a feature, resulting in the opportunity to wander off the path before a user sees what you have done.  Historically we have never managed to get  the MMFs correctly defined, which results in rework and extra costs.  The approach of developing some of the functionality and then getting feedback is a hallmark of Agile and leads to better business alignment by allowing the team to react to change from the business.  This works better with smaller, role based stories.</li>
</ul>
Even with these shortcomings, Kanban's lean manufacturing approach is interesting as it should really help a team identify process bottlenecks, and I suspect could be applied in a more Agile manner of development.

I am sure you all will have lots more comparisons and thoughts on how Kanban could make your Agile approach better. Let us know what you think!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Mike, you hit the nail on the head…. but I would caution on stating that the items you mentioned as shortcomings.  The whole idea behind kanban is JIT from manufacturing perspective so we should not expect it to have these agile characteristics.  This is where the ’lean’ comes to play; where smaller stories make a big difference so that things get delivered in manageable terms, iteratively, and to expectations.  On the other hand, kanban allows workers to deliver bigger chunks of the product without the constraints or limitations of a timebox.  Sometimes with agile we struggle with delivering a feature that may be too large of the ideal sprint timebox but partial delivery of the feature does not make sense.  Lots of pros and cons; best to use what fits the project.  Or if we can leverage the strengths of both, that would be even better.  When introducing agile to large organizations, one great impediment is support organization SLAs.  I’m sure kanban can help streamline their processes which will allow them to support agile projects in an agile way.
Just my 2 cents…

		<title>Who Do You Trust? Thoughts from the Integrating Agile Conference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the opportunity to present at this year's <a href="http://agileconsortium.nl/en/conference.html">Integrating Agile Conference</a> in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  The daylong event was kicked off and closed by two fairly famous Agilistas.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="OutSystems.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/OutSystems2.jpg" width="300" height="234" /></span>

First, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hkniberg">Henrik Kniberg</a> kicked off the event with an excellent keynote address focused on the value of Agile when applied correctly.  Check out his blog post on "<a href="http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg/2008/01/03/1199369940000.html">Failing With SCRUM</a>." During his presentation Henrik made some great points regarding root cause analysis.  I found one of his examples quite interesting - using his root cause analysis technique he had helped a customer uncover that the real issue was a lack of <b>trust </b>between IT and the business.  While Henrik's main point was about how Agile is simply a 'tool' that when applied correctly will improve application development, I found his point about trust most interesting because in my experience Agile, when practiced properly, will help overcome a lack of trust between IT and the business.  More on trust in a moment...

The closing keynote was given by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rob-thomsett/1/464/226">Rob Thomsett</a>.  I was actually late to the closing keynote but very glad I got to hear most of it.  For those of you who, like me, do not know of Rob, he is an 'old guy' with some very interesting insights into Agile.  You can read some of Rob's thinking in his <a href="http://www.thomsett.com.au/content/thomsett/blog.asp">personal blog</a>.  While I don't know Rob, I felt like he was an old friend after his presentation - I guess that means he is a great presenter!  He is obviously a Star Trek fan and since he mentioned Stevie Ray Vaughn he must love music. BTW, I am sure if he reads this blog post he will chuckle about the "old guy" comment!

Rob also made some great points during his presentation regarding management style; agile adoption issues and he also hit on the point of trust.  He took the issue of trust beyond the relationship between IT and the business by calling out most of the audience (IT folks) and making the point that trust started with the technical team <i>trusting each other</i>.  <b>Does your technical team trust each other?</b>  Something to think about!
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" alt="Agile Holland and Agile Consortium logos.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Agile%20Holland%20and%20Agile%20Consortium%20logos1.jpg" width="150" height="119" /></span>

It was a great day in Holland for Agile - with over 100 people all sharing and learning.  For me, a key take away is how important trust is to being successful!

I hope you will share your Agile experiences and how they have helped your business and development team overcome trust issues!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I keep seeing 3 levels of missing trust:
<b>1) Trust in Agile per se </b>- there's still a lot of discussion whether agile pays off or not. Many companies still don't "trust" agile to deliver on its promises. We should all be past that point, with all the good examples around...
<b>2) Trust in the technical team </b>- not following a strict plan and adapting as you go scares a lot of tech people who think their folks will be running around like loose sheep.
<b>3) Trust by the Business </b>- they've heard and seen so much coming from IT for the past decades that mistrust is now tattooed in their brains. Agile is actually the best way to change this since, for the first time, business will see real business value being delivered periodically by IT.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Mike,
Indeed a very interesting and enjoyable day.
Many thanks for the invite!
Rob's answer to my question about cultural differences and Agile adoption made me write an weblog post on cultural dimensions of countries related to the level of adoption of Agile practices / methods:
<a href="http://www.approach-alliance.nl/index.php?option=com_jd-wp&Itemid=2&p=115" rel="nofollow">http://www.approach-alliance.nl/index.php?option=com_jd-wp&Itemid=2&p=115</a>
To me it's about more than trust 'alone'

		<title>Will the REAL user please stand up! Involving the right customers in Agile projects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["<i>Scrum brings the customer and the development team together as often as every sprint.  Because the customer is involved throughout the development process and is consulted once per iteration, the team can never deviate very far from the customer's vision.</i>" says <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/BetterSoftware/magazine.asp?fn=cifea">Laszlo Szalvay in his recent Better Software Magazine article on SCRUM</a> in which the author does an excellent job of providing an overview of SCRUM. <!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="better software magazine.gif" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/better%20software%20magazine1.gif" width="200" height="268" /></span>
Personally, I couldn't agree more and I think he nails this key point about SCRUM. I suspect that most of you will be aligned with this too.

As an application development practitioner from the "old days" for me, iterative development and continuous business user involvement is the ultimate Agile truth - it's the best way to keep projects on schedule and deliver a high value solution.

But now for the real question about customer involvement:  <b>What happens when you don't have the <i>right </i>customers involved?  </b>

Last week I was discussing an Agile project with one of our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Training/">OutSystems Engagement Managers</a> and he described this exact issue. The team was very excited to tackle this project using Agile methodology as it was going to be the first for this particular client's business area.  The business was on board, trained on Agile and they had the full support of the management who were committed to participating in planning user stories, each sprint demo, backlog settlement, etc.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" alt="trenches.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/trenches2.jpg" width="143" height="222" /></span>The problem was that the supervising managers were not the ones who would use the application on a daily basis and were somewhat out of touch with the processes and issues on the ground. What happened? The management team met with resistance from the guys in the trenches about the initial app - and then what? ...they changed their minds about the functionality. Ultimately this proved to be a positive experience as the Agile and SCRUM-based approach they used caught the mismatch early and the resulting app was accepted.   So, the lesson here : beware - management participation is critical but you also need the real end users to make sure you don't get too far off track!

<b>Have you come across this type of issue on your Agile projects? How is Agile helping your projects deliver better software?</b>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's why in Evo (Evolutionary Project Management) we use the concept of 'Eagerly Waiting Stakeholders'.
We make (biweekly) Deliveries in order to get feedback. If we deliver to Stakeholders who aren't eagerly waiting, then we don't get the appropriate and timely feedback. If the Stakeholders we need to provide feedback don't provide feedback, we feed them 'juicy bits', in order to make them eagerly waiting.

		<title>The Agile Remedy:  Curing Outcome Uncertainty?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>"<i>The uncertainty of outcome is the only certainty</i>" </b>This should ring true to every Agilista out there.  Let me give you a minute to think it through.  When was the last time you worked on an application development project where the outcome was certain?

In my 25 years in the IT industry the outcome has never been a given.  Oh, I tried ... we did formal analysis, with Information Strategy Plans, Entity Relationship Models, Process Models, Use Cases, Flow Diagrams, Class Diagrams and the list goes on.  But in the end, it only got us so far.  The reality was that things changed, we got stuff wrong and the result was not what was expected. <!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="eye test2.JPG" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/eye-test21.jpg" width="220" height="310" />

I recently ran across a couple of great Agile techniques (with crazy acronyms) to help remedy all this outcome uncertainty that I wanted to share:

<b>1. IWKIWISI</b> -<b> "I Will Know It When I See It." </b> For many of us this is a reality.  We have some general ideas as to what we want but will not be able to articulate it exactly.<b> </b>Agile's "deliver early and often" is key to addressing this issue.<b></b>

2. GrASBI - <b>"The Great Axiom of Software and Business Indeterminacy"</b>.  This term was defined in a recent CIO magazine blog by Michael Hugos titled "<a href="http://advice.cio.com/michael_hugos/agile_techniques_agile_hype_and_the_essence_of_agile_in_it_and_business?page=0%2C0">Agile Techniques, Agile Hype and the Essence of Agile (in IT and Business.)"</a>  The key idea is that having a general idea of what you will deliver will get you close to the expected result, and that having detailed definitions of what you will deliver will not get you any closer.  The challenge is, of course, getting the business to change habits and recognize this truth.

We all grapple with shifting the traditional development mentality (both IT and the business) to one based on Agile concepts.  One of the hardest behaviors to overcome is this new way of defining direction and refining as we go.  So, let's overcome GrASBI, empower our application of IWKIWISI and get Agile!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Miguel and I were recently discussing an interesting presentation by Martin Fowler and Rebecca Parsons on engaging the Architecture team into your Agile methodology.  The presentation is titled "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/agilists-and-architects">Agilists and Architects: Allies not Adversaries</a>" and the summary points out that "As Agile becomes more accepted, concerns from architecture groups are increasing. Traditional ways that architects engage with development groups conflict with Agile methods."<!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="boxing 2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/boxing%2021.jpg" width="235" height="207" /></span>
With architecture being a core component of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/Solution.aspx?FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/ITSolutions/AgileMethodology">OutSystems approach to Agile</a> application development and the role of Delivery Manager, we thought it would be interesting to share this presentation and ask the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/Forum_View.aspx?ForumId=29&amp;ForumName=Agile+Methodology">OutSystems Community</a> how you have embraced architecture while practicing Agile in an Enterprise setting.

For example, many of you are successfully delivering a high degree of reuse while focusing on delivering individual applications.  While OutSystems' Agile Platform provides a solid foundation for refactoring code and adjusting architecture in progress, we suspect that there are many instances where your Corporate Architecture team needed to play a role in moving the application delivery forward.

So, if you are a Delivery Manager or Architect it is time to share your experiences of working together in an Agile application development project.  How much education was required?  Did you feel resistance? What were the lessons learned?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been doing software architecture work for quite some time. Both with and without OutSystems platform, and in the recent year adopting agile methodologies.
What I seem to find out is that Agile goes hand in hand with large and distributed systems architecture. By nature these systems already change a lot. We've been trying to reach patterns since the beggining of ages that allow for easy maintenance, no (or low) impact on performance, and most of all, accelerated development. This requires design both at a high level as well as a low level.
Yes, we're agile. However, we cannot drop the high level design up front. We need to have a (not very clear) vision of what we are going to need. And agile copes with that. I found out, when moving to OutSystems, that you are provided with the most relevant patterns from scratch. The very nature of the platform extension mechanisms won't let you easily fail. It also provides you a kind of Domain Specific Language approach from the beggining, that will force you to create (and all developers to follow) well defined guidelines. All the assynchronous design patterns are also easily mapped to the patform potentials in timers. When coping with external systems or a corporate company architecture definition there's not much to trouble us as well. We're either at SOA (which OutSystems fits like a ring) or some other kind of integration pattern, for which you know you'll have an integration layer only for transforming/transporting/auditing/etc., that will be either implemented out of the box, or via a simple extension. All this facilities reduces the effort in defining the high level architecture, assuming you're confortable with the usual design patterns. This way you don't have to go very deep on the initial architecture definition. Just focus on business components/modules decoupling.
I am now in a software factory with a very large architecture basis. The only thing required is that, whenever a new requirement appears, you do an overall architecture impact analysis. If you have the above topics considered, you end up in having a new component. If the business requirement changes (and you'll adopt it "immediately" because you are an agilist), it will probably fit in its own business component, or have relatively low impact on the surroundings.
What about when there's a requirement that reaches all levels? If you've decoupling from the start the Core entities (business domain core - the ones you usually specify the DSL for) from the business components/processes on top of them and also from the integration layers, there's no big issue. You'll probably end up in refactoring some core processes to decouple even more, so that the new requirement fits in an isolated way.
This proved me that agile will make you good architectural choices. And if you know from the start you're going agile, the architecture will come out much stronger and maintainable, just because of the fact that you're thinking, from the beggining of ages it will be ment to change.
Kind regards,
Gonçalo Borrêga

		<title>A Five Step Agile Roadmap</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/07/a-five-step-agile-roadmap.html</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2009 16:53:14 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/508731-1414786">LinkedIn question</a> asked for advice on how to get a company started down a path to Agile and SCRUM. I thought it might be useful to share some advice and see if the OutSystems community had any ideas to add.

At OutSystems, our roadmap is strictly a guideline because companies have different methods, cultures, and management approaches. When introducing Agile, here are the steps we generally go through. Concepts and activities that are emphasized will vary based on understanding of the customer culture, organizational structure (formal and informal), as well as their prior knowledge of Agile methodologies.<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="agile roadmap.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/agile%20roadmap1.jpg" width="383" height="238" />

<b>1. Education</b> - first, level-set those involved in the roll out. We found that there are many different levels of understanding of what Agile is even if people say they "get it". Part of this process is to make them actually go through the process before the project begins. At OutSystems, we have "<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/agile-in-a-day">Agile-in-a-Day</a>" training sessions that provide participants with a hands-on introduction to help develop real understanding of key concepts and activities. If you have a project already selected, involve the business sponsor, business manager, and key business users.
<b>
2. Project Definition / Selection</b> - Once everyone is clear on the vision and direction, a project can get started. The project may have been identified earlier but how the project is chosen or what criteria was used needs to be understood. Since this is the first Agile project, we need to make sure that risks at this level are addressed to help ensure success for both project and process. The criteria for selecting the project needs to include the solution's level of complexity, visibility, resources, and integrations.

<b>3. Execute Project</b> - Now we start the project by educating the target users if they were not involved in the initial Agile-in-a-day. Go through the project kickoff; explain the methodology, roles, responsibilities, timeline, deliverables, etc.; fairly standard project stuff and along the way - expunge the word "scope" from all project documents, thoughts, and discussions. Work on the backlog, feature negotiations, the sprints, scrum meetings, demos, etc. Once a sprint is done, do a retrospective and refine the processes for the next sprint and the next project. Once the solution is in production, conduct <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/01/the-tuning-sprint---driving-application-adoption-using-agile-methods.html">a tuning sprint</a>. This is a special sprint we do at OutSystems to ensure 100% adoption by implementing features that will boost adoption and conducting both solution performance &amp; platform tuning in the production environment.
<b>
4. Perform Project Retrospective</b> - apply lessons learned to subsequent projects and refine other processes. Note that this process improvement will involve Support organizations and dynamics between project teams. One of the things we often encounter is that Support organizations cannot move as fast as the project sprints and tend to delay Agile projects. Similarly, non-Agile projects have a difficult time addressing the integrations with Agile projects. As you execute your first project, you will find that you may need to bend or even break some rules to keep your project on track as defined by your timebox. Therefore at the end of the project, you will need to work with Support and other internal organizations to establish new protocols or processes specific to Agile projects.

<b>5. Iterate Steps 1-4</b> - In our experience, we found it necessary to conduct multiple Agile-in-a-Day sessions to get everyone in the company level-set on the organization's approach to Agile. Agile is a mindset change; expect hurdles and naysayers. Besides, change is always difficult even if the participants are willing, able, and have executive sponsorship.

(Unofficial #6 - Be realistic and good luck)

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice summary -- although I notice from your illustration that the process, if followed, will leave me somewhere in New Jersey. ;-)
Serious question: Why do you expunge the word "scope" from all project documents in step 3? I know that we shouldn't go into the project with preconceived notions about its scope. But within each sprint, don't we need to maintain some control over the scope of the work? Otherwise wouldn't we fall victim to "scope creep" and our sprint become more like a series of mad dashes?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Larry, scope creep is simply not possible if Scrum is followed.
- The business or customer, via the Product Owner, determines what features or stories are most important.  The PO asks the team to work them in the order of importance.
- The team determines how to implement and how long it will take to implement the stories.
Anyone deciding that the team must do more within a specific time frame is violating Scrum and agile.  The company must trust that the team is really doing the most they can.  The team must return that trust by really producing what they have committed to do each Sprint.
The company can add as many things to the Product Backlog that they want.  The team will continue to work in Sprints that contain a fixed quantity of work for that Sprint.
There is no scope creep.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Larry, thank you for commenting on my post.  I’ve never been to New Jersey (other than EWR), thought it would be interesting though…
In all seriousness, there are two reasons why the word scope should be avoided: (1) it implies all requirements need to be delivered; and (2) it to negates and undermines the budget.
Yes, I agree that when you start a project there should be an initial scope but that is just it –  an initial scope to help define the project timebox and budget.  I look at the word “scope” as a carryover from waterfall approach as it keeps users thinking the traditional way… something we want to change.  Note that we’re not changing the way they perceive scope but rather the way they value budget so that we can put scope in check.  The traditional way is to keep the scope intact while the budget changes which causes project delays, overruns and ultimately unsatisfied customers.  Reality is scope will change (and even increase) but budget will not.  It is much easier for the users to change their mind about scope but very difficult to increase your budget.
By making the users think in terms of budget, we get them to focus on what requirements are most important to them.  We work sprints based on highest-value requirements without compromising the sprint’s timebox.  Remaining high-value requirements plus changes based on end-of-sprint demos are reevaluated as part of the next sprint’s backlog.  We stress that if there are new requirements, lesser-valued requirements will be shifted outside the budget… still in scope but outside the budget (think next release).  Bottom line we don’t discuss about whether a requirement is in scope or not; all requirements go into the project backlog.  What matters is if there is budget for it.
I hope this helps.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for raising this issue! I've recently learned a big lesson: how scope can be a bad word. Last week I had a meeting with my Engagement Manager (EM) and customer Project Manager (PM). Our objective: resume a project that was delayed for about 2 weeks due to lack of specifications. So far so good, we did avoid some budget burning with that pause but we were still uncomfortable with all the missing dots. We simply had too much open requirements and we were unable to get more info about them. Since it was time to review the plan for tighter sprint dates and a go-live, we clearly had to make a statement about our timebox. In my presentation I included the topic «scope increase». The PM immediately perceived that as a budget threat. Understandably he couldn't possibly believe how a month-and-a-half contract could have been consumed in just 2 weeks effort. «Poor choice of words...» our EM apologized, we really did mean «Backlog increase» :) Of course we had to explain that the budget itself was not in danger but the go-live date instead which seemed quite near given the amount of features requested and still not fully analyzed. So eventually we would need to add some features after the go-live. That seemed a totally different meaning. Moreover, the fog is now less thick with a recent Q&A session and more clear requirements. This is a day that I now laugh about very relieved…

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for the simple presentation and good advice.  I was surprised that you only recommended a project retrospective though. I find with teams who are just starting Agile that more frequent retrospectives are more helpful. A retrospective after each sprint allows refinements to the process and shared learning at the same time.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Paul, thank you for your input.  We do retrospectives after every sprint.  See step #3 Execute Project, (“Once a sprint is done, do a retrospective and refine the processes…”).  I wholeheartedly agree that sprint retrospectives should be done and yes, it is a means to recall and share lessons learned and “relearned”.  It is the relearning part that is always a concern of course as it may be an indication that the process is not working or that the project participants skipped or did not fully understand the process or the impact of not doing something.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Don't think about it</span></b> - what's the one word that springs to mind when you think of "Agile" in terms of application development? Write it down somewhere.<!--more-->

<div align="left">

The above video is from this year's OutSystems <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">NextStep</a> users conference where we asked Agile Platform users from around the world for the one word that they felt summed up Agile. Some of the responses: Change - Flexibility - Success - Efficiency - Time-to-market - Quick - Mandatory - Build-to-change - Web 2.0 - Faster - Quick - Success...Most are about speed and flexibility - but interestingly "Fit for purpose" and quality of application (measured for example, in terms of how well it delivers what the business needs) are not mentioned.

Why not?    Is it just this set of people who responded this way?   Does the Agile community at large think speed over quality?

I can't speak for the rest of the Agile community but in terms of the OutSystems community, I suspect a number of things:

1)    Waterfall has led to an expectation of extremely slow delivery...and so the excitement over rapid iterations and speed of delivery.

2)    Having the business guys on the team throughout the process, coupled with rapid iterations means by default the results are high quality ... and so quality is being taken for granted. Their main concern now is how to increase the number of projects that use the Agile approach without slowing things down.

3)    They're all using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/Agile-Platform">Agile Platform</a> (sorry, shameless plug) that enables rapid delivery of large-scale apps using Agile and SCRUM methodology and are very happy with the speed.

I'd love to hear what other practitioners in the Agile community think is their "one word" - but either way, I think one of the most important issues here is that we, as practitioners and people who are teaching newcomers about the benefits of Agile, remember that it's not about quality OR speed - Agile is all about quality AND speed.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Quality, speed, flexibility, etc all come from one source, the ADAPTIVE (rather than prescriptive) nature of agile development.
Adaptive is therefore my one word. Do and test seem to come pretty east to most teams transitioning to agile but to complete the circle they need to learn from the test and ADAPT, otherwise there's little point.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Speed is commonly referred as one of the main outcomes of adopting agile.
I think that has to do with the fact that with Waterfall, people were used to see a first (crappy) version of the application only after 18 months... with agile they get to see a working version after a couple of weeks, and then see it evolving every week during the sprint demos. That gives people the notion of speed - things happen fast and they get to see the application evolving every week.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You are either jumping to an unwarrented conclusion, or purposely choosing a title and position (a 'straw man' of sorts) that is of the 'modest proposal' type designed to cause a reaction and drive traffic to your blog.
Fact: speed was not the most common answer, "change" was
Fact: nobody in the video gave an answer that indicated a LACK of quality.  nobody said 'shoddy' 'slapdash' 'buggy' or any other one word answer that indicated quality was lacking or being sacrificed.
So everything on the right hand side of the = in your title is bogus..  'Change' would be more accurate than 'speed' when it comes to the most common theme in the answers.  and there's no basis to add 'over quality' to that, because there is nothing in the answers given that provides a basis to onclude that the respondants thinking was anywhere along those lines.
So what are we left with??  'Agile = Change'..  but of course that's old news and doesn't make for a good blog title to slather all over linked-in and anywere else you cna find to promote you blog.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[as said by chuck nobody said lack of quality.
Actually in my experience (and I guess everyone on the agile projects I know) would say agile is speeding thing up because of quality.
there are other parts why agile is speedy, but quality is a necessary part of it.

The joy the customer gets when they actually get a product that they want.
The joy the team gets in actually building stuff that works that people actually want.
Yeah - I dig all the  quantitative  improvements.... but gosh darn it doesn't it just _feel_ better?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I just posted this to a linkedin group in response to a question and thought I'd put it here too. In the video people were answering the “one word about agile” question and the crowd was a mix of folks experienced in Agile and some who were just starting, during an OutSystems Agile users conference.   I think that the original blog post was intended to drive a conversation about the benefits of agile  – but the title of the post, as a few have noted, did not communicate this well.  The video was just used as a trigger for new ideas and answers, and was not directly related to the title (which should have been clearer - apologies for any confusion).
There have been some great responses both with “one word” question and the speed-quality discussion, plus lots of valuable lessons learned about blogging!

I wouldn't sell Agile on being quicker, although we might get down to actually making something a bit quicker than with waterfall, the final finished product could take as long, surely?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Agile is about early return on investment and reduced risk (value) a side effect is that it delivers faster..quality is not usually a variable as this would simply slow things down and reduce the ability to deliver value in subsequent iterations. Yes the concept of velocity is used in Scrum and this does imply speed but the fundamental aim of agile is to be couragous and to be truthful...unlike traditional approaches which try and hide behind a plan which does not reflect the reality which is software development is empirical and cannot be planned in detail upfront.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Even if speed is the first and most important attribute of an agile method, it is a mistake to think that speed comes at the expense of quality: in fact, increased speed should drive improved quality. Why? Because poor quality no longer has any place to hide. In a long waterfall delivery cycle, poor quality can creep in anywhere, and inspection (a very ineffective technique) is really the only way to find it. Typically, poor quality only comes to light at the end of the project, when you are already behind schedule, and so quality is compromised in order to avoid the schedule getting even worse.
On the other hand, if you are operating with a long series of very short delivery cycles, then you can no longer afford to inject poor quality into the product, because the impacts to everyone and every aspect of the project are almost immediately apparent.
Think of it like a runner's gait: if you're running slowly, you can use almost any gait you like, and get away with it; as you speed up, though, the problems with a poor gait become more apparent and less sustainable.
The other analogy, from lean manufacturing, is inventory reduction. As you reduce inventories (analogous to reducing your inventory of partially developed software) you are forced to fix quality problems in order to maintain delivery schedules.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In June this year OutSystems had its annual Summer Event at the beach in Portugal - and we thought we'd share some of the fun! The weather was amazing, the sea temperature was just right, the drinks &amp; food were wonderful and everybody had a great time!

After dinner our very own "OutPerformers" hit the stage and gave a rousing performance - with the entire OutSystems team dancing and singing along!<!--more-->

Here's a video with a few highlights of the party (soundtrack by "The OutPerformers" of course!)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a recent conversation I was asked about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_the_Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge">PMBOK</a> (Project Management Body of Knowledge) and its applicability to measuring an Agile project manager's effectiveness.  While I did not know much about PMBOK and its measurement approaches I was curious to understand the problem.  As it was explained to me, the problem was along these lines...<!--more--> When following a PMBOK approach to measuring a project manager's effectiveness, one of the things you would look at is on-time delivery.  If the project was delivered exactly on time the manager would get a rating of one.  If the project was delivered ahead of plan then the manager would get a rating of less than one (based on how much ahead) and vice versa if delivered late.  However, when following the OutSystems approach to Agile application delivery we define a project timebox and even if we deliver all features early, we will then fit any additional backlog items into the plan and keep working until the timebox is complete.  Thus, you never finish early - you always finish on time and in most cases you just exceed your customer's expectations on how much you deliver!

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="sprints.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sprints2.jpg" width="476" height="167" /></span>So, off I went and did some research on PMBOK.  What I learned is that the OutSystems Agile Methodology, while based on SCRUM, incorporates lots of extra management concepts that align with PMBOK.  (BTW - If you are not familiar with the OutSystems Agile approach here's a <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/Content.aspx?ContentName=8Steps_Overview&amp;FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/ITSolutions/8StepsToAgile">white paper</a>.)  I will leave the convergence of Agile and PMBOK for a later discussion, but in my opinion, there are lots of PMBOK practices that are applicable to running Agile projects in Enterprise IT shops.

What I am interested in is the following - What is a good measure of an Agile project manager's success?

In the conversations on Agile and PMBOK I've had over the last couple of weeks I have come to the conclusion that the best measure for an Agile project manager's effectiveness is not based on on-time delivery, staying within budget, etc.  But rather a measure of a new application's adoption by the business!  Everyone I have talked to on the topic agreed with this notion of adoption but none have really offered a concrete technique for measuring adoption.  In most of the discussions the notion of return on investment came up as a solution.  However, in drilling into ROI we always came to the conclusion that while ROI is important it is not necessarily a good measure of your project manager's effectiveness.

So my quest for a good measure of an Agile project manger's success continues.  Everyone agrees that application adoption could be it but I have yet to find anyone with a good definition on how to measure it. Your thoughts?
You should follow us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/outsystems">here</a>.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mike, I understand your question but my initial gut reaction is fairly non-PMBOK.  I teach Agile as a we all swim or we all sink.  So everybody's success is tied to a projects success.  That said we still live in a world of "personal performance measurement" this is where the manager has to understand Agile AND be close enough to the team to know who is doing what but far enough away to not get in their way. This would apply to the PM as well.  Are they correctly facilitating the meetings, are they inviting all necessary people, are they removing obstacles for the team, etc.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the using the measurement of delivering on time is a maybe not the best way to evaluate a PM. Given the statistic about 70-80% of IT projects failing, I always get scared of PMs who grade themselves by their ability to deliver on time or in budget.  It would be hard to get up each day if I had to look at myself and say, "Today, 80% of the things I do will result in failure" (meaning late, over budget, etc.)
As a PM, the way I measure my own success, and the success of the PMs who work for me is based on  ability to follow the PMBOK (assuming they are PMPs) in a way that works best within the org/culture, creates as little noise or process overhead as possible and keeps the client fully aware of status and making informed decisions.
For an Agile PM, I'd measure success on the person's ability to apply Agile practices within their PM practice.
For me personally, I serve the project, then the client, then the company I work for. I manage the process very diligently, keep the client fully informed and I push the decisions back on them.  If the client wants to move in a direction that is almost certainly going to result in failure, it is my job to make sure they know what they are doing, what the risks are, etc. If they still want to go that way, I am responsible for getting us to fail as efficiently and quickly as possible and then having a backup plan for recovery.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Mike,
I echo what David has explained - it's all for one and one for all when it comes to Agile.
It's also worth noting that there is no such role as 'Project Manager' in an Agile environment. I don't usually get caught up in semantics, but feel this is a pertinant point as the 'Project Manager' title implies that a single individual is responsible for the project outcome. This isn't (shouldn't) be the case.
In a Scrum environment you've got your Product Owner, Product Manager, Scrum Master and Scrum Team. All are responsible for different elements of the delivery, but all are jointly responsible for the combined outcome.
I've written a few posts about measuring the performance of an Agile Team... this is summarised in the <a href="http://agile101.net/2009/07/18/agile-balanced-scorecard-measuring-the-effectiveness-of-an-agile-software-development-team/" rel="nofollow">Agile Balanced Scorecard</a> series.
With that said, although these metrics are useful, the best measure of performance is stakeholder satisfaction.
Let me know your thoughts! :)
Thanks,
Tara

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What is the purpose of AGILE/SCRUM?  Is it about more than on-time and on-budget parameters as Dave mentioned?
Having managed Enterprise IT projects as well as product development for 10 years I see an aspect of Agile that I don't see mentioned much.  But it is the key to the project's success.
Yes, it involves applying Agile practices --- but it also involves the ability of a PM in enable a project team to become self-managing.
Many Agile PM's can apply the practices, but enabling a team to truly be self-managing and owning the success of a project is where the magic lies.
When you look back on project success using Agile or PMBOK.......if the entire team owned the success, not just the PM and the core team members, then a project would shine and customer satisfaction would rate super high.
Thoughts?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My opinion is that the project's success can be determined by the adoption of the business, and not the Project Manager's. The Project Manager's is always related to the on time on budget. If you're way behind schedule, and you're way over budget, regardless of the methodology, then there's something that's not very right. On the other hand, a project, in and for itself, can be a success even if you're behind schedule and over budget.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mike/Tara,
Salient points from everyone.  As a software consultancy, there is the purely financial success factor of actual profit versus forecast profit (we're a subsidiary of an accounting firm - this is an obvious first consideration :-)).  We cost all our projects based on resources and their base costs versus actual cost as the project progresses through to completion.  Most projects expect to include an amount of bug-fixing but most clients clearly won't pay for this aspect of 'failing QA' so this would affect the overall project efficiency.  However, even with this in mind, our projects to date are still looking at >95% efficiency (this compares with 80-85% on previous fixed price projects using other approaches.
However, I agree with Tara's last comment about customer satisfaction.  The key aspect I impress upon everyone in my team is that if we make our project sponsor (for us, this is the external client) look good then we have a successful project - notwithstanding the financial success criterion above.  Perhaps given that 80% of our business is based on repeat business within customer accounts this sort of success factor is continuously being self-tested - using an agile approach is enhancing our reputation within our clients and is a major contributor to us continuing to gain repeat business.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[IMO, any measure of Agile success should pitted against the Agile Values ...
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
I personally feel the delivery of working software is the number one goal. Since Schedule and Cost is fixed, and Scope is what varies, I would tend to want to measure success by looking at Scope; that is, did you meet or exceed your sprint goal? If so, you succeeded. If not, there is room for improvement somewhere. Look to your Retrospectives for that information.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[- How closely the finished project ties to what the customer wants AT THAT MOMENT (not what was written in some spec doc 8 months ago)
- How little overhead the developers and testers and others need to spend conforming to your processes (ie. during this time they are not writing code, etc)
- How much turnover there is among the developers (the project manager plays a big role in setting the culture - he can be an enabler or a thorn in their side)
Schedule is irrelevant.  Everyone wants things done faster than possible.  Developers always agree to an overly optimistic estimate.  There've been a million attempts to "fix" this but basically there is no fix so long as people are pushing to get things faster.  The only way to fix this problem is to accept that the schedule is actually an irrelevant metric.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Must there be metrics?  Let’s see… this is a very subjective topic and very many factors involved.  Adoption… hmmm, maybe a good metric. But for me adoption is more a measure of the application meeting the needs of the business (with the necessary usability factors applied of course.)  But is that really a measure of the PM’s effectiveness?  Indirectly perhaps; more bragging rights than anything else.  In an agile project, the team should really be credited for that.
I think a PM’s effectiveness in any project, agile or not, is a combination of things - (1) managing the triple constraint; (2) managing the expectations across the board; (3) project delivery.
Things change over the course of a project; it’s inevitable.  Typically what changes is one or more of the triple constraints. The PM needs to be on top of these so that expectations are set and reset accordingly.  No surprises.  Project delivery to expectations is key.  It may not be delivered on the original date specified; could be before or after but if the PM properly manages the expectations and the impact to the triple constraint then I would say the PM was effective.
Of course, that’s just my opinion.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lean/Poppendiecks say there's no such thing as technical success, only business success.  An architect can't take credit for a beautiful design when the product doesn't sell.  Similarly, there's no such thing as Project Management success, only business success.  High productivity, high quality, using TDD, scrum etc. don't count for much if your client is not happy or your product doesn't sell.
All for one, one for all ....go Tara!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Mike (et al),
I would suggest that the true measure of the success of <b><i>any</i></b> project manager (‘PM’ from here on) is the <b><i>final</i></b> customer acceptance of an <b><i>on-schedule</i></b>, <b><i>on-budget</i></b> deliverable that meets the <b><i>agreed-upon scope and quality</i></b>. Whether you’ve obtained that acceptance thru multiple delivery cycles using methods or thru a Waterfall-equivalent single delivery cycle process, a PM’s reason for existence is to <b><i>ensure customer satisfaction</i></b> independent of the development methodology employed.
As Dave Prior points out, the project – hence the client – is first, then the company. Of course, in order to accomplish this goal, the PM will have necessarily ensured the success of the team and its members in terms of job satisfaction, career advancement, rewards, and overall performance realization, including himself/herself. This also pertains to the stakeholders as well – their satisfaction would also to have been met in order for the PM to meet the success criteria.
As far as ROI is concerned, that particular metric will have (must have?!) been determined prior to the initiation of any project, otherwise that project would not exist, and by meeting the success criteria for cost, schedule, scope, and quality would by definition indicate that the ROI for the project had been met, thereby contributing to the success of the company as well.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To be fair to PMBOK, it has not mentioned "on-time delivery" as the factor; it is only one of the factors.
I also agree with the view point that "there's no such thing as technical success, only business success". Solution which is not aligned with organization culture, does not enhance team synergy, fails to deliver on business value is not worth a dime for that content, no matter how technically superior that solution is.
However, I am concerned about attributing success or failure with a specific individual/role. It is conventional wisdom but goes against the core of what agile stands for, as I know it.
I believe, agile stands for demonstrated value, continuous and effective communication, honesty and transparency, and togetherness. I believe, just as quality, success/failure is a collective responsibility. Failure hits everyone hard, irrespective of the roles; not just customer, project manager, business analyst etc

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Rewarding and measuring individual performance is biasing and potentially dysfuncional. (on-time, budget, etc.)  Be careful!  I really encourage to read Austin:"Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations". It is logically provable. You get the idea from my blog <a href="http://bit.ly/2ZQiKK" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/2ZQiKK</a>
Exactly the same applies to projects. One project is a one-time endeavour. In long term product development, rewarding one project most probably leads to local optimization.
PMBOK gives advice how The Project Manager, takes care of The One-time Endeavour. However it may not be appropriate with software product development. In this blog I describe what I have seen happen. <a href="http://aritikka.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/focusing-on-projects-ruins-your-business/" rel="nofollow">http://aritikka.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/focusing-on-projects-ruins-your-business/</a>
As Poppendieck suggests, the business success is a good measure.
What I said concerns product development. From the customer perspective, the receiver, a one time-endeavour and the project metaphor may apply.
Best Wishes
Ari Tikka

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Agile PMs know there are stakeholders, customers, project team members, outside vendors and others typically.  To meet expectations and enable team ownership, an Agile PM must have those relationships in place to get the inside scoop.  Inside scoop on what?   The hidden expectations, hidden agendas, competing priorities your team members are battling with, etc.    Successful Agile PM’s must know and deal with these issues and risks – and relationships are the key way to discover and manage them.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the record for success for a PM is simple. Customer satisfaction, and money earned. I've been a PM for almost a decade now, and while there are many different strategies to completing a project properly and on time, ( I prefer a midway status check) the fact of the matter is, if the client is satisfied, then the project is a success. I was looking for <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/project-manager-jobs-SRCH_KO0,15.htm" rel="nofollow">project manager jobs</a> and salaries, and I was surprised at the varied salaries for a single job. I think it is keystone to know your value to a project and an internal knowledge of cost. If a project is asking too much for too little, then walk. Solid rules are hard to come by in this business, the only constant is the client will always want something by a deadline and we will have to adapt.

I have some interest in how the usual metrics should adjust to software factories, with very large lifetimes, where sometimes speed - and also acceleration - of the team is already stable, and delivery on time/budget is already not a concern.
If you can dive into that i would appreciate a lot.
Thanks

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week's Agile2009 in Chicago was a pleasant surprise in a couple of ways.  First, in a down economy the conference attracted nearly 1400 attendees from around the globe - which is outstanding considering many conferences organizers we've talked to are reporting a 30% decline in attendance. According to the organizers 60% of the attendees were first-timers at the conference which is a testament to the quality of the event. And, there was a large international contingent - we met lots of Aussies, Kiwis, Brits and Europeans; in fact it felt like 50% of the Agilists we spoke to were from outside the US - and great to meet them all! <!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="attendees2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/attendees22.jpg" width="467" height="133" /></span>Second, after four days of interacting with other conference goers we noticed two trends that were very different from last year's conference:

a) The majority of attendees are now actively practicing Agile and have participated in multiple projects.  Last year it seemed many people were attending in order to learn about Agile in preparation for their first project.  This year, our informal (and unscientific) survey showed 53% have been personally involved in over 4 Agile projects.
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="outsystems team agile09 small.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/outsystems%20team%20agile09%20small1.jpg" width="200" height="203" /></span>
b) Sprint duration among participants has dramatically reduced from four weeks last year - to two week sprints this year.  During one of the conference sessions this year "Death by SCRUM Meetings," a session attendee told us he estimated the majority of the audience who were polled on the average length of their sprints said <i>two weeks</i>.  This prompted the OutSystems team to do an informal survey of the people we talked to, which confirmed the number - two weeks is the norm for sprint durations.

Agile is definitely becoming main stream. <a href="http://www.agile2009.org/keynotes">Alistair Cockburn's keynote "I Come to Bury Agile</a><a href="http://www.agile2009.org/keynotes">, Not to Praise It"</a> made this point - the days of small co-located teams following the Agile Manifesto are dead and gone.  Today we have very large distributed teams tackling big problems which are changing the face of Agile as it was originally conceived.  The term Agile now encompasses so much more than just doing things faster - Agile is dead, long live agile.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="attendees.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/attendees3.jpg" width="493" height="152" /></span>
<div align="left">As promised, here's a summary of some of our favorite sessions and our main take-away's:</div>
<b>
</b><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Keynote+at+Agile2009.pps"><b>I Come to Bury Agile, Not to Praise It</b> </a>- Alistair Cockburn
<b>Main Take Away</b>: Agile has grown up and no longer in the domain of the few; it has now received the attention of large scale enterprise and evolving faster in terms of maturity.  It is taking on a life of its own.  The speaker noted that he observed this to be true because Agilists are now in the "ri" stage of the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">shu-ha-ri</a>" concept.  "ri" being where an individual is now capable of inventing and blending concepts and into new approaches but still within the "Agile" umbrella.  ("shu" - learning a methodology, "ha" - collecting techniques, "ri" - inventing and blending techniques).
<b>
<a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/231">Introduction to SCRUM</a></b> - Henrik Kniberg
<b>Main Take Away</b>: Scrum seems to be the most popular of the agile methods because of its ability to incorporate any technique or tool in its use. Interesting quote for us agile &amp; tools people "Do not develop an attachment to any one weapon or any school of fighting." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a>, 17th Century Samurai.

<b><a href="http://agile2009.org/node/2762">WANTED: Seeking Single Agile Knowledge Development Tool-set</a>,</b> Brad Appleton, Peter Alfvin  <b>Main Take Away: </b>Companies in very complex environments developing embedded applications, corporate applications and everything in between will continue to struggle with disparate tools.

<b><a href="http://agile2009.org/node/681">Agile in the Enterprise Corporation, Panel</a>:</b> Israel Gat, Stephen Williams, Laureen Knudsen, Scott Killen  <b>Main Take Away:</b> Why Agile? It's about the money!  Do feature budgeting.  Develop and maintain a release model in a business framework.  Get the organization on board within the dynamics of your specific company - collaborate.  Re-organize to Operational and Executive teams that are cross-functional and make their interaction with R&amp;D asynchronous.

<b><a href="http://agile2009.org/node/2433">Marriott's Agile Turnaround</a></b> - Jesse Fewell <b>Main Take Away</b>:"Agile can't fix bad strategy"

<b><a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/2989">First, Kill All the Metrics</a> </b>- Niel Nickolaisen , Chris Matts
<b>Main Take Away</b>: Reward and punishment results in meaningless metrics and thus not all metrics we use are meaningful.  For a metric to be meaningful, it has to measure process and not people; they need to be aligned with the objectives and strategy of the organization; and should show trends.  Metrics that measure people tend to result in unhealthy competition between team members especially in a self-regulating / high performing team.

<b><a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/736">Strategies in Replacing Systems in Agile Projects</a></b> - Niklas Bjornerstedt
<b>Main Take Away</b>: Presentation discussed a number of patterns in replacing systems and recognizing these patterns can help in the process.  Although there are patterns that can be used to help in transitioning users, migrating data, etc.; it still boils down to a case by case basis.

<b><a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/2763">How to evolve a Product Backlog </a></b>- Ronica Roth, Mark Kilby
<b>Main Take Away:</b> The main discussion centered on following the user work flow to evolve the product backlog.  Along with that, ask questions on the 'what' and the 'why' primarily.  The 'how' questions need to focus more on the current processes and not necessarily on the future although it would be good to note that.

<a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/248"><b>Agile Metrics</b></a> - Dan Rawsthorne
<b>Main Take Away</b>: The talk was directed to organizations that are new to agile.  One of the key points is to level-set on metric-related terminology like what "done" means so that there is no confusion between team and customer.  A suggestion was put forth to create a "doneness criteria" which essentially is a checklist.  Other terms were velocity and capacity that accordingly most folks new to agile get confused on.  The speaker suggested that velocity = capacity until proven otherwise.  Capacity is what you estimate you can do and velocity is what you have proven you can do.

		<title>Measuring Agile Success?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month our company announced its new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Content.aspx?ContentName=agilityaward-Jul09-PR&amp;FolderPath=%2fRoot%2fContents%2fCorporate%2fLandingPages%2fNews%2fagilityaward-Jul09-PR">Agility Awards</a> - and the first set of awards were presented for <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Customer.aspx?FolderId=4724&amp;ParentFolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/Customers&amp;SectionName=Customers"> five Agile projects</a> that had been completed by customers and partners using  OutSystems' Agile Platform and employing Agile methodology.

The question I want to pose is what are good criteria for assessing a successful Agile project? This question builds on Mike's recent post about <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/08/whats-a-good-measure-of-an-agile-project-managers-success.html#comments">criteria for measuring an Agile project manager's success</a> - and we got lots of great responses and ideas in the comments. <!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="agility award.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/agility%20award1.jpg" width="102" height="296" /></span>
The data points being used by the OutSystems team to evaluate whether projects are eligible for an award are:
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 1em;">1.    Size &amp; scope of project: the project should be of medium to large scale (over 40,000 software units in size.)</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">2.    Project definition &amp; objectives: the project should deliver significant and measurable business value.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">3.    Project approach: the project should have been run based on Agile practices, following an iterative development approach with regular end user involvement.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">4.    Project metrics: a baseline of project metrics must be submitted in order to measure the impact of using Agile to deliver the application.</span></blockquote>
The team then use these data points to assess whether an Agile approach was employed to deliver the project on time, on budget, with 100% user adoption and delivered true value to the business and IT.

<b><i>Is this list a reasonable set of data points for measuring the success of an agile project? </i></b>
BTW - Here are some examples of the results from the initial set of award winners (read more details <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Customer.aspx?FolderId=4724&amp;ParentFolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/Customers&amp;SectionName=Customers">here</a>):

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>XDx - Analysis Request Management System</b></span>

<b>Time-to-market:</b> 6 weeks + 1 for launch; Number of Agile sprints: 3

<b>Customer quote:</b> "This was our first Agile project and it achieved the two key business goals: avoiding tracking errors and improving real-time data consistency for our studies. Most importantly, we were able to deliver this value to the business in a record time, exceeding both developer's and user's expectations and establishing Agile as the preferred methodology for this type of development project." - Jochen Scheel, Director at XDx.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>
RWE - Tiger, Implemented by Atos Origin</b></span> (BTW - <a href="http://adi.atosoriginblog.nl/2009/09/10/atos-origin-wint-agility-award-met-rwe-outsystems-project/">nice blog from Atos Origin</a> on the project &amp; award here)

<b>Time-to-market:</b>14 weeks; Number of Agile sprints: 5 + 1 tuning

<b>Customer quote:</b> "The Gas Portfolio Management application was implemented over a period of three months which was only possible with the OutSystems' Agile Platform and methodology. Their way of sharing information, processing activities and reviewing project deliverables with key users of RWE NL was instrumental to the success of this project."- Perry van de Goorberg, Project Manager at RWE.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>OK! teleseguros - Sales Platform and Home Insurance, Implemented by Keep It Simple</b></span>

<b>Time-to-market:</b> 13 weeks; Number of Agile sprints: 3

<b>Customer quote:</b> "This project was a true success as it exceeded the business's expectations in terms of objectives achieved and above all business benefits. The Agile Platform and methodology allowed the business to engage the development team and see the immediate impact and results of all project changes and decisions." - Sérgio Carvalho, Marketing and Product Director at OK! teleseguros.

* From Development Team's Point of View:
** Learning
** Satisfaction
* From Customer's Point of View:
** Learning
** Delight using the Product
* Improving the state of Software Development? (both inside the company and in the community)
* Innovation and joy?
Regarding:
>> 1.    Size & scope of project: the project should be of medium to large scale (over 40,000 software units in size.)
Its interesting to see the mapping of size and scope to software units (estimates). Who cares what the estimates? Esp. when your unit of estimate is very different from my unit of estimate. With this point you are almost encourage people to "create" (bloat) their requirements and estimates. When the opposite would be the right thing to do.
>> 2.    Project definition & objectives: the project should deliver significant and measurable business value.
How do you measure business value? When do you decide you have achieved the business value is achieved?
IMHO the other 2 points are also very iffy.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Naresh,
Good input.  I want to clarify the measurements Robert outlined in his post.  They are part of OutSystem’s Agility Award program.
The scope and size of the project is specified in software units as this is a metric automatically generated by the Agile Platform.  Software units are like function points - they estimate an application's size and complexity.  The minimum size of 40K was picked as we only want to recognize agile projects that delivered something more than a proof of concept.
Note, we are aligned in keeping applications as lean as possible while meeting the business needs.  This is a core concept of OutSystems' Agile Methodology.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you all for your input.
I guess it all boils down to how you define success after all.  For OutSystems, we look at success as on-time, in-budget, and 100% user adoption.  Seems fairly straight forward but not really.  There are lots of things that factor into these, especially with 100% adoption.
Achieving an on-time and in-budget project requires a high-performing team that has the wherewithal to make things happen positively.  Any team that can accomplish this always has some level of satisfaction; bragging rights at the very least; granted satisfaction and joy are very subjective.  Frankly, measuring the team’s happiness does not really add value to the business.  We’d rather keep this internal and recognize as such; but we also want to mention the team along with the award.  Focus is really on the business itself.
What about value to the business?  We let our customers measure this as this depends on the application itself; we recognize that each application has its own success criteria.  For example, if you are deploying a call center application, wouldn’t you measure specifics about how the application has impacted the average call handle time or the first call resolution?  We can’t very well outline criteria for all type of apps as part of the award so we figure, 100% user adoption would cover it.  Here is why:  the more an application is used, the more value it provides.  When we deploy an application we want feedback from all users.  This is very important to the adoption process.  Once users see their suggestions implemented, the more satisfied they are, the more they feel empowered and the more they will use the application; the more value it provides.
Just as we let our customers measure how successful they are; we also let them decide when the application has indeed achieved the intended objectives. Besides, it’s their right to brag about their own successes; we merely recognize them for their achievements.
Regarding, quality and what happens after deploying an application… one of the tenets behind agile development is constant user involvement; to see their input evolve into a live application sprint after sprint is a great satisfaction for them.  So why not extend that after the application goes live?  We know the business evolves and we believe the application needs to evolve in-pace with the business.  Our Agile Platform enables IT to change, test and deploy applications very quickly.  To change or add new features very quickly means that quality must be built-in into the application; an easy feat with the Agile Platform even if you need to refactor at the architecture level. Once an application is deployed, it enters into an evolutionary maintenance where constant feedback from the users will keep the application evolving along with the business… agile maintenance.
Applications built with the Agile Platform are built for change.  With evolutionary maintenance, success is not a one-time achievement; it is constant as the application continues to evolve with the business.

<img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="trophy.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/trophy2.jpg" width="200" height="362" />

We considered several ways of doing this. We pondered doing a traditional PowerPoint presentation; we thought about assembling a mandatory reading list; we entertained the idea of adding support on our tools for some of the Agile tenets; and so on...but in the end we decided to organize a contest around Agile to help new team members learn about the methodology the fun way!
<blockquote><b>Let's play: Who wants to be an Agilionaire?</b></blockquote>
The idea is simple. Each week a question about Agile was sent to the entire team. The question was accompanied by 4 possibilities, and the contestants had to pick the right one. Everyone could reply to the question within 24 hours, and the winner would be the person with the most correct answers. You can <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/who-wants-to-be-an-agilionaire-questions-answers.html">check the questions &amp; answers here</a>.

This approach worked really well, and had a lot of advantages over any of the other methods - here are a few:
<ul>
	<li><b>People were encouraged to look for an answer.</b> This not only ensures people are paying attention to what you're teaching, it also promotes self learning.</li>
	<li><b>The questions were picked based on the real issues we witnessed internally.</b> This means that people were <a href="http://usablelearning.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/id-webcomic-1-working-with-smes-on-content/">learning what they needed most</a>, not every detail on Agile.</li>
	<li><b>We sent a small justification of the answer with references to sites, blogs, and books on Agile</b> - and provided more bibliographical references than we could ever hope to transmit on a single presentation.</li>
	<li><b>We got an idea of people's knowledge on Agile.</b> Now we are aware of how much people know about Agile (and the results were very good, I might add). We also have an idea of the areas where specific people need more help, and will use this knowledge to help them get up to speed.</li>
	<li><b>Everybody participated.</b> If we had done a Power-Point presentation, I'm sure we wouldn't have had everybody raising their hands.</li>
	<li><b>It was really cheap!</b> There was no time invested in preparing the presentation or in changing the internal tools. The only work required was preparing the questions and answers.</li>
	<li><b>It was fun!</b> Everybody liked this idea, and we got great feedback from the team! It was surely more fun than going through a 2 hour presentation on Agile...</li>
</ul>
2 months and 8 questions later, we have a <b>WINNER</b>! Miguel Melo had the brilliant result of 7 out of 8 questions right, proving to everyone that he's a <b>true Agilionaire</b>! To celebrate the victory, Miguel was awarded a priceless handmade trophy (built and designed at OutSystems;) an adventure pack to prove he's also Agile out of office; and he gets to show up in the Agility Blog! Congratulations Miguel!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["I'd like to thank my wonderful family, all my colleagues for their support..." :-)
Seriously, though, having worked on quite a few companies prior to OutSystems that did not employ the Agile methodology it is now easy to see why so many of those projects never reached fruition. It is very easy for the developers - myself included - to be so caught up in solving a problem that they cannot see the wood for the trees.
On the agile way, at all times (be it on the daily scrum or the bi-weekly iteration meeting) the overall validity and return on investment of what we are doing is assessed. This allows the success of the overall product, rather than the grokking of a technical problem, to be the constant objective.
While the geek in us may feel that technical realization should be an end in itself and all these checkpoints simply stifle creativity and lead to demotivation, let me tell you there is nothing more frustrating than having a project (where you poured your dedication) canned because at the end you just produced and delivered "the wrong thing". Actually, there is... it's when you didn't deliver at all because the whole thing was so unfathomably ambiguous and convoluted it could not be done. I've lived through both scenarios and it's not pretty.
In regards to the contest itself it was also held in an agile way! It allowed for the tackling one question at the time rather than people being handed a questionnaire that no one would have bothered to answer. Timeboxing also came into play: we answered as many questions as the time frame proved to allow. Very cool.
Finally, I should say that the missed question was due to me not hitting the deadline, which comes to show that there is always room for improvement in everyone's project and time management skills...

		<title>Agile Development - A Juggling Act?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have recently started playing the "Ball Point Game" in some of our informal Agile learning sessions. This is a game played by some scrum trainers. The basic objective of the game is to get as many balls through the team as possible within two minutes. Each ball must be touched at least once by every team member and must end with the same person with whom it began. After two minutes the team is allowed an additional minute to discuss the process and how it could be improved. It is recommended that the game be played a total of five times or sprints. You can learn more about the game in this <a href="http://kanemar.com/2008/04/07/scrum-trainers-gathering-24-the-ball-point-game/">Scrum Trainers blog post</a>. <!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="ball point game.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ball%20point%20game1.jpg" width="165" height="163" />

When I was first introduced to the game I wasn't quite sure what Agile concepts I would learn about.  Was this about the importance of <i>retrospectives</i>; <i>scrum meetings and communication</i> or <i>scrum of scrums</i>?  What I learned were some interesting aspects of all these topics plus, what I think was the real message from the exercise - with <i>experience</i> comes speed and quality, and experience can be injected into the team when done at the right time!

So for those who don't know this game it is very simple and quite fun. A good team building exercise even if you are not practicing Agile.

<b><i>Watch this video now </i>and my findings below will make more sense.</b>

<b>Mike's findings from the Ball Point Game</b>
As you can see, the game was fun.  If you did not notice the video was from two different sessions; one session was in Lisbon, Portugal and the other in the 'sunny' England.  (I know, hard to believe it was sunny in the UK!)  Let's reflect on the four topics I mentioned above:

<b>1. Retrospectives are really key for the delivery team to be able to adjust and improve.</b>  They also give you a point in time to measure your effectiveness as a team.  Important if you are interested in improving!

<b>2. <i>S</i></b><b>crum meetings and communication are part of the secret sauce for agile.</b><i> </i> It was very evident in the video.  You saw the teams discuss their performance, brainstorm ways to improve and then implement the improvements.  Of course this concept extends beyond the 'ball passers' to the whole Agile team including the business users, testers, etc.  If you don't have regular interaction across the whole team the Agile process breaks down very quickly.

<b>3. For large teams the concept of "Scrum of Scrums" is critical.  </b>Our first group was very large, there were four separate delivery teams and their Scrum Masters met to discuss the 'project' and then collaborated with the smaller teams.  While I agree this is important, it begs the question - management in Agile projects?  Of course if you read this blog regularly you already know that for Enterprise agile to be successful you need some good project management!

<b>4. Experience is critical for success.</b><i> </i> If you go back and look at the video you might notice that before the last sprint the teams get a nudge from an experienced player.  In this game's case the nudge is about 'maximizing' resources - and this meant passing two balls at once.  This would never have been considered in the earlier sprints but with a little experience to direct the teams they easily adopted the concept and really improved their performance.  A bit of a warning: a good agile coach will let their team build on their skills and not introduce a 'nudge' too early.  I suspect that if we had given the team the "two hands" advice after the first sprint it might have proven less beneficial as the teams had not progressed enough in their working approach to successfully implement this advanced concept.  Food for thought.

So, both groups improved their efficiency many times over from the first sprint.  In addition, if you would have asked them if they thought they could double their throughput after each sprint they would have been skeptical at best.

And the final lesson:<b> Keep an open mind, learn from experience, and be willing to fail - just do it fast and adjust!  </b>

Let me know if you have played the game and what your take-aways were.

		<title>Driving Agile Success - A CIO&#039;s Mandate</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2009/10/driving-agile-success-a-cios-mandate.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The challenge we see in many Enterprise IT shops is that it is hard to get everyone across the business who touches application development 'on board' with an agile approach.  In this blog post I want to share how the CIO of one of our customers has set guidelines which help drive agile project delivery across the business.<!--more-->

The customer is a large Portuguese food distribution and consumer goods manufacturing company, with an international presence.  With nearly 25,000 employees they are used to having huge IT projects, involving multiple departments with complex requirements, large budgets and long timelines.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="cio-mandate2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cio-mandate22.jpg" width="210" height="261" /></span>

Before agile, many of these projects were delivered late, over budget and in some cases actually failed.  In 2005 they became an OutSystems customer; embracing the Agile Platform and an agile methodology. As they matured in their agile practices, the CIO saw the value and <b>today they operate under the CIO's mandate that only projects scoped with a timeline of less than three months and a budget under 300K will be approved. </b>

<i>What happened before the CIO mandate was put in place?  Here's what they told us:</i>
<blockquote>1. They would spend two to three months in meetings, aligning all opinions in order to create a huge requirements document;

2. When they finally started developing the systems the business team had disappeared and in most cases forgotten about the project;

3. By the time the project was ready to be tested the key users had changed, the business had changed and the project delivery team immediately entered into a lengthy negotiation phase to reconcile what was delivered versus what the business really needed.</blockquote>
<i>This customer states that with the agile methodology and their new CIO mandate they improved the success rate of their projects in several ways:</i>
<blockquote>1. The business team is more motivated and involved as they are able to see how the projects are progressing on a regular basis;

2. The business gets to be more responsible for the decisions that shape the project direction because they see and constantly test the application;

3. The business and IT avoid the costly, wasteful exercise of building complex requirements documents because they now fully realize that they can never document every detail in a specification;

4. From very early on in the project, IT can see if the project is really what the company needs and identify any mis-matches quickly to reduce the amount of time, dollars and resources that might be wasted.

5. Even for big projects, Agile methodology is used - and forces the team to split the project into phases. This exercise divides the scope into smaller, manageable projects with incremental releases and decreased risk.</blockquote>
So, both for this CIO and many others, we are finding that an agile approach to application development really helps increase project success rate and reduce risks.  Even in a company like this one that has complex application needs, lots of departments and bureaucracy - agile really works!

What are the technical leaders in your company doing to help drive agile project delivery?  Or, what would you like to see them doing?

Share their rules, guidelines and mandates along with your ideas!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for this post Mike. It's great to hear of Agile success stories in large companies.
I'm curious as to why the CIO had to mandate that projects no longer than 3 months and larger than $300K had to be implemented? Was this needed due to the culture of the company so that they could get people more involved? Do you think that they could have been successful with Agile w/out the mandate?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Robert,  my understanding is that the CIO mandate is helping the whole company shift their thinking from a large monolithic project mentality to one where they break down their problems into smaller chunks - important for Agile success.
As for the 3 month window and project $ size I did not probe but assumed this was the threshold where longer projects got out of control.  I will reach out and see if we can get more detail re your question.  Stay tuned!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Robert - Maybe the point was that a large six month project could be broken into two three month projects, thus delivering a portion of what was needed quickly.
Also, constraints tend to focus people on what is most important.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The issue is to pressure business to focus on what is really important and plan things incrementally.
Trying to add every requirement and every little detail into an analysis phase as they were used to tend turn specifications into a never ending project. By trying to limit and focus business and IT into this all new process and methodology also starts in the beginning of every project estimates. Of course this does not mean that they do not have big projects but they budgeted and planed into different phases.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been a proponent and practitioner of agile-like methods since long before the Agile Manifesto changed the face and the rules of effective software development. Back in the day, that was regarded as treason by the MIS departments, even though the benefits could be clearly demonstrated to the business people. No one in those days could have gotten away with the strategy employed by the CIO of the Portugese food distributor; it was just too radical, unproven and unbelievable an approach for anyone to contemplate. Today, it's clear that agile methods have the power to change the way business thinks about software, and makes possible the substantially more complex applications that business is demanding. Thanks for a great story.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were all very excited to hear one of our customers, Max Rayner, speak at the recent <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/index.jsp?eid=431&amp;id=296">ALM Expo</a> on how he and his team built and delivered the <b><a href="http://www.fly.com/">www.fly.com</a> </b>system using an agile approach. If you're not familiar with it, this is an internet application that's openly available and was built using <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-methodology">Agile methodologies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">SCRUM</a> techniques and an <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">Agile ALM toolset</a>.<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="MAX_RAYNER_s.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MAX_RAYNER_s2.jpg" width="94" height="113" />Max is the CTO of <a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/">Travelzoo</a> - a travel publisher with 18 million subscribers and fly.com is an online app that helps you find the exact match to your air travel needs. During the webcast Max discussed the problem space, their agile approach, the innovative metasearch engine, how they managed a distributed team, challenges, key learnings and reasons for their success.<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="travelzoo agile approach.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/travelzoo%20agile%20approach1.jpg" width="456" height="337" /></span>With all that said, I can't really do the webcast justice in this blog as there was SO much great information shared - but you can:

1) download the <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/res/webcast%20presentation%20slides.pdf" target="_blank">webcast presentation slides.pdf</a></span> and listen to the podcast <object width="200" height="20" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /><param name="src" value="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/player_mp3.swf" /><param name="flashvars" value="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /><embed width="200" height="20" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/player_mp3.swf" FlashVars="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" flashvars="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /> <!--more--></object>

2) view the <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/index.jsp?eid=431&amp;id=296">full recording of the webcast here</a> (unfortunately, you will need to register but its free and painless.)

3) or, you can download the <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/SP2_download.jsp?mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3_unisfairId=1663235772">podcast of the presentation here</a> and listen in your own time.

BTW, the recordings include a great Q&amp;A session that I would highly recommend listening to!  Here are some stats Max shared on the fly.com agile project:
<div><b>Duration </b>
<ul>
	<li>Expected: 28 weeks  Actual: 32 weeks</li>
	<li>Number of Sprints: 14 (including a tuning sprint,) Number of Demos: 12</li>
	<li>250 change requests (using Agile Platform Embedded Change Technology)</li>
	<li>4 week tuning sprint &amp; 4 versions released during tuning</li>
</ul>
<b>The Team</b>
<ul>
	<li>Business Sponsor: Chief Technology Officer</li>
	<li>1 Engagement Manager, 1 Delivery Manager, 3-5 Developers &amp; 1 QA</li>
	<li>7 Key Users</li>
</ul>
<b>Technology</b>
<ul>
	<li>OutSystems Agile Platform used for: requirements gathering, design, integration, component assembly, version control &amp; configuration management, deployment &amp; performance management</li>
	<li>Over 20 integrations w/ databases, third party systems etc</li>
	<li>.NET environment.</li>
</ul>
<b>I believe this case study to be a great testament to the Agile development approach; the project achievements speak for themselves</b>:

<b>1. </b>Fly.com is able to handle a sustained load of 40,000 searches per hour with 99.8% availability<i></i>

<b>2. </b>Fly.com functionality delivered with less cost &amp; faster than competitive solutions

<b>3. </b>6 months to deliver working system that was stress tested, and then new features added to meet &amp; beat the competition

<b>4. </b>Less than 1 year to develop &amp; release what competitors had taken 2+ years to achieve

<b>5. </b>Compares prices from hundreds of airlines &amp; online travel sites with just one user search.  Integration of 12+ distinct information providers in real-time, aggregating all the data received, stored &amp; made available asynchronously

<b>6. </b>Links to hundreds of external sites with over 30 types of parameter formatting &amp; integration methods.
<i>
What were your major take-away's' from Max's webcast?  Have you come across other case studies of major applications that have been built with Agile methods?  Are these Agile case studies useful to you and should we publish more here?</i>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been seeing a lot of discussions around the ability to deliver complex solutions using and agile approach, and this is living proof that "yes you can!"
Another subject that is frequently debated is the use of geographically dispersed teams in agile projects. From I what I know about this project, the team was divided in two regions with an 8h time-zone difference. Again, this proves that agile projects with dispersed teams are possible and can be very successful.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Before using Agile Methodologies I thought it was just a buzz word. But after seeing it in practice it's amazing how the project gets a dynamic of it's own where important thing gets done and everyone contributes for the goals at hand. Can't see myself going back to old methodologies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we released a new version of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">OutSystems <b>Agile Platform - 5.0</b></a>! In this version we're <b>taking agile a step further</b>; not only are we supporting the entire application lifecycle management for web applications, we also added support for IT teams to rapidly develop <b>business processes using agile methodologies.<!--more--></b>

Traditionally, business process development was done at a different pace using different tools than IT used for application development. However, one of the biggest challenges facing the business process world is the integration of business processes <i>with </i>applications; which meant one of them was always waiting for the other.  And, in the case of our customers who already use the Agile Platform, web application development was happening faster than business processes development.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="integrated agile process and application management.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/integrated%20agile%20process%20and%20application%20management1.jpg" width="486" height="191" /></span>With version 5.0 of the Agile Platform, we have closed that gap! Using the new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/business-process"><b>Business Process Technology</b> </a>capabilities of the platform, IT teams can develop business processes <b>totally integrated with web applications </b>in an agile manner. All artifacts that the Agile Platform provides for Web Application development - like TrueChange technology, 1 Click-Publishing, Real Time Monitoring, and so on - are also available for business process development.

To develop this new capability, the OutSystems R&amp;D team partnered with one of our customers, <a href="http://www.vanameyde.com/">Van Ameyde</a>, to design and implement this capability. Van Ameyde uses business processes intensively for insurance claims processing and has very heavy change demands for those processes. Customer participation has been key to the development of the new 5.0 functionality, and we believe that it led to a pragmatic implementation of Business Process Technology that will allow IT teams to fulfill the needs of the business from a process perspective, as fast as they have been doing for web applications with the Agile Platform.

Along with Business Process Technology, version 5.0 includes many other improvements that will make developers a lot more productive. If you're already using the Agile Platform, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/ViewTopic.aspx?Topic=What%27s-new-in-the-Agile-Platform-5.0">check the videos</a> of some of the improvements we made to the platform. If you want to give it a try for yourself, the best thing to do is <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">download the (free) Community Edition</a> and try out the new capabilities of the platform.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="team.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/team2.png" width="500" height="400" /></span>Of course, we could only release such a great version of the Platform with a great team! We had a lot of help from a lot of people, in particular from our Beta customers who provided such excellent early feedback, and a special thanks goes to the 5.0 team that delivered such a great product! Version 5.0 of the Agile Platform will definitely raise the bar for agile.  Give it a try, the 5.0 development team promises you that it ROCKS!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a lot of blogging about agile estimating and planning but most, if not all, that I've come across only pertain to after the project has been started.  Further, what is being estimated and planned is for the iterations.  So <strong>how does one define budget for the agile project itself</strong>, specifically a web business application project?  I mean, the cost of the hardware, 3rd party software, facilities, etc. everything except the actual software development cost can be fairly straight forward to budget. <!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="4 aces planning poker.JPG" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/4-aces-planning-poker1.jpg " width="318" height="212" />

But what about the software development cost?  Using conventional methods or techniques is certainly an option but they do not account for the fact that agile projects tend to cost less when compared to similar projects.  So, perhaps this is not the way to go. Besides, business owners want to know what they're getting for their money and how much it is going to cost them.

At OutSystems, we solved this by taking the following <strong>3 steps</strong>:
<ol>

	<li>First, we work with the business to gather and transform high-level requirements into user stories.  Stories highlight features that detail what the user wants to do (e.g., create, list, search) to specific objects (e.g.customer, store, loan).</li>
	<li>These features are patterns of implementation; it is the patterns that are estimated in hours based on years of experience delivering agile projects successfully and this experience is encapsulated in our OutSystems Agile Network Sizing (ANS) tool (BTW - you can see a demo video <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/demos/DemoScreen.aspx?Movie=Agile-Management--Budgeting-and-scoping-an-agile-project">here</a>).  The tool allows us to set various influencing variables such as number of developers, iteration size, number of user profiles, etc. that enable us to adjust the estimates based on complexity levels.  There are always unknowns during funding and these variables help provide a means to shore up those that may require more attention during the project.</li>
	<li>Given the resources, we are able to calculate what we call the ideal project timeline, complete with sprints and a target go-live date.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

You can probably use story points to achieve the same thing assuming you have a common baseline and have equated points to some level of effort which, in turn, equates to dollars.

<strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">What if you get funded without this process?</span></strong>

Let's say your project gets funded but you did not use patterns or story points to determine your budget.  You start the project and gather your user stories, prioritize them and the size them.  You conduct your sprints and over the course of say 3 iterations, calculate your average velocity and capacity.  Having your averages, you can calculate the average cost of each iteration and thus the project itself; also, potentially determining when you will run out of budget.  Unfortunately, when using story points and a burndown chart, you still cannot predict with enough certainty when the project will be done. To most stakeholders, stating an approximation or a moving target date is just not acceptable even if you stress the benefits of going agile - early delivery, handling evolving requirements, software that meets specifications, early risk mitigation, etc.

So what do you tell them?  How do you accurately estimate the time and cost it will take and then convince the stakeholders that the project will be done on time and within budget?   Do you give odds when answering when the project will be done?  What do you do if you run out of budget?  Are you gambling with your budget?

Here's the process we've developed:

a) We bootstrap the stories, budget, timeline, sprint definitions from the sizing tool into our project management tool - the OutSystems Agile Network Project (ANP).  The bootstrap process calculates the budget for each iteration based on the overall budget.
b) Each iteration is allocated a budget for development, technical debt, change requests, testing, and sprint review.
c) Once the information is in ANP, we review the stories with the business, prioritize them and even negotiate what goes in an iteration, just like any other agile project.
d) We also break down the user stories into work-items and estimate them (in hours) in conjunction with the developer(s) assigned to complete them.  It is the work-items that we commit to deliver for the sprint.  This helps us ensure that we do not exceed the iteration's budget.

In summary, estimating based on patterns enables us to define the project budget.  Resource estimates and other influencing variables coupled with the budget enables us to provide a project timeline and target go-live date.  This information allows us to manage the project at the sprint level ensuring that we are on target while not exceeding our budget.

What method(s) do you use for estimating project budget and timeline?  What method(s) do you use to ensure you deliver within budget and on time?]]></content:encoded>

At the end of the training I show them the weak spots:
1 - The value chosen is different in each team.
2 - The team will chose relatively lower levels as soon as they are more experienced. So the Velocity calculations has to be adjusted over time.
3 – The required team is NOT available at the time the project budget is requested.

		<title>Agile Beyond Development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This weekend I had the opportunity to speak at <a href="http://engineering.sogeti.nl/Home/index.jsp">Engineering World 2010</a>, a conference dedicated to analyzing the next step in engineering maturity and productivity. This conference is organized by <a href="http://www.sogeti.nl/">Sogeti</a>, an OutSystems' partner, and was held at the Achmea Conference Center in Zeist.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="sew2010-collage.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sew2010-collage2.png" width="214" height="387" />
<div>I got there at about lunchtime, and the building entrance was filled with about 200 people getting ready to eat. I would've liked to attend the other presentations, but unfortunately they were all in Dutch... As soon as I got there, I was briefed on the proceedings of the conference and moved on to prepare the room; after I've gotten a typical dutch lunch consisting of sandwiches, that is!</div>
<div></div>
<div>By the time I started there were still a few empty chairs, but overall the room was nicely packed. My goal was to talk a bit about how <b>Agile concepts and practices apply to the full software lifecycle</b>, not only to software development. I gave particular attention to software maintenance, since it accounts for about 85% of the IT budget.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I started out by giving a short introduction on Agile, and quickly moved on to the juicy stuff. To illustrate my point, I picked a few examples of important or recurrent issues that occur when working in maintenance mode:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Staging and Deploying</b></li>
	<li><b>Gathering User Feedback</b></li>
	<li><b>Cost of Change and Technological Debt</b></li>
	<li><b>Fitting Business Processes in an Application</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For each of these issues, I talked about the problems they pose to both developers and management; I also showed how the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> addresses each of these challenges, to give a better idea of how you can apply <b>Agile beyond development</b> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kutuma/agile-beyond-development">you can see the presentation slides here</a>).</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was very happy with the audience's reaction to my talk. There was a lot of nodding in agreement with the problems presented, and I'm convinced <b>a lot of them had already experienced the troubles I was highlighting</b>! I also spotted a lot of curiosity about the way the Agile Platform helps decrease the burden of maintenance, and I'm guessing a few of the attendants will download the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">Community Edition</a> of the Platform to give it a try!</div>

		<title>Scrum Projects for the Enterprise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week the second annual gathering of the <a href="http://www.scrumpt.com/">Portuguese Scrum User Group</a> took place in Lisbon. It was a great opportunity to meet with people that are actually doing agile projects in several different contexts. The meeting had a great set of speakers, including the co-author of Scrum <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsutherland">Jeff Sutherland</a>, <a href="http://mitchlacey.com/">Mitch Lacey</a>, <a href="http://www.fe.up.pt/si/FUNCIONARIOS_GERAL.formview?p_codigo=231081">Ademar Aguiar</a> and myself.

I had the opportunity to speak at this event!<!--more-->

The event started at 9a.m. with Jeff's talk about Hyper productivity in Scrum teams. The room was crowded with around 150 people. This audience was particularly interesting because of the mix of experience vs new people. There were a lot of people that wanted to understand what is this thing called Scrum and the rest were a good mix of experienced Scrum users that wanted to learn and share experiences with each other.

My presentation was all about sharing experiences! OutSystems has been delivering agile projects since it started with a very unique 'dual' context.  On one side of the spectrum we develop a software product - the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> - by a dedicated set of Scrum teams that work in OutSystems R&amp;D department.  On the other side of the spectrum, we have a team of Professional Services that delivers enterprise web applications using the Agile Platform following an agile approach.  This team has delivered over 600 successful Agile projects! Pretty amazing and where I decided to focus my presentation...

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="scrum-gathering.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/scrum-gathering2.png" width="500" height="193" /></span>
The challenge was to identify from all this experience a couple of topics that would be of value for any team that delivers Scrum projects for the Enterprise. In my research for this presentation I came up with 4 major issues that the industry complains about when adopting Scrum (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marioandrearaujo/scrum-meeting-lisbon-2010-by-mario-andre-araujo">you can see the presentation slides here</a>):
<ul>
	<li>How do we do fixed price projects? After all customers want to know how much will it cost before signing a contract, right?</li>
	<li>Where's the Product Owner? Namely when you are delivering to an enterprise with little experience in Agile with multiple stakeholders.</li>
	<li>Dealing with immature teams. What is the most common challenge teams face in order to become self-organized?</li>
	<li>Handling distributed teams. The question is, can we deliver with distributed teams?</li>
</ul>

For each of these issues, I shared how we've overcome them with specific examples from our own projects and sometimes with references and examples from known authors in the Scrum community. Please feel free to check out my slides and share your thoughts on the challenges you and your organizations faces using your Agile approach.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We recently met with <a href="http://lwsoa.blogspot.com/">Lawrence Wilkes</a>, Director and Principal Consultant with <a href="http://www.everware-cbdi.com/">Everware-CBDi</a>, to talk about how IT departments are addressing their legacy systems.

We will post Lawrence's response to the following three questions over our next few blog posts:
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">What are the top three things you've seenpeople do to successfully address the competing demands of new build vs. legacy modernization with limited resources?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Is there a role for model-based tools like the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> in legacy modernization?<!--more--></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">What are the top three mistakes people make when addressing their legacy?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;">
</span><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="lawrence wilkes.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lawrence%20wilkes11.jpg" /><b><span style="font-size: 1em;">#1 </span></b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>  <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">What are the top 3 things you've seen IT do to successfully address the competing demands of new build vs. legacy modernization when faced with limited or shrinking resources?</span></b></span>

<b>LW: </b>My experience is enterprises that are really successful tend to buck the trend. They are more radical and don't just "follow the crowd". Rather, there are usually one or two key people who have an architectural vision that breaks new ground - at least from their organization's perspective. Typically they will:
<ol>
	<li><b><i>Combine application modernization and business improvement programs.</i></b> They get business stakeholders involved in understanding the options for modernizing, both in terms of business needs and the applications that allow a more radical approach to be taken to requirements.  They avoid the knee-jerk reaction of buying a package or simply outsourcing the entire problem because they are seen as expedient options that, however, often results in something that is no better able to respond to change than the legacy it is replacing. Instead, they are keen to search out economies of scale and cost; capitalizing on existing investments in applications where possible, rather than just throwing them away, and break-down organizational and application silos to create solutions that are genuinely more flexible.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b><i>Keep business design and architecture in-house</i></b>; create strong architecture and Centers of Excellence (CoE) roles that are able to exert strong architectural governance over outsourcing and delivery. They do not allow the outsource parties to gain control, nor do they lose knowledge of their business, applications and environments.</li>
	<li><b><i>They use agile approaches but are not slavishly following the conventional "agile" manifesto</i></b> - agile needs to be used within an architected, governed framework, not ad hoc. They establish a formal reference model and framework, which allows rapid delivery and governance of products, delivered by an agile process.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<i>What steps has your organization taken to successfully address legacy systems while delivering new systems? </i>

In our next post we will address Q.2 and the role of <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">model-based development tools</a> play with legacy modernization.

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Lawrence Wilkes is a Director and Principal Consultant at Everware-CBDI. Lawrence is a frequent speaker, author and consultant on best practice in SOA, Application Modernization and Enterprise Architecture. Via CBDI Forum, the Everware-CBDI research capability and portal, Lawrence has led the development of the CBDI-SAE methodology and supporting Knowledgebase, which is used by both end-user organizations and system integrators around the world. Lawrence has an extensive background both within end-user and vendor organizations having worked both in the business and IT side, which brings particular insight into business/IT convergence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/03/dos-donts-of-legacy-modernization.html">previous post</a>; here is the second interview question from our conversation with <a href="http://lwsoa.blogspot.com/">Lawrence Wilkes</a>, Director and Principal Consultant
with <a href="http://www.everware-cbdi.com/">Everware-CBDi</a>, on how IT departments are addressing their legacy systems:

<b>Q.2  Is there a role for model-based tools like the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> in legacy modernization?<!--more--> </b>

<b>LW:</b> Although a large part of the functionality may be based on those that already exist in legacy systems, there is still a need to design and assemble the new solution that is typically focused on supporting a new business process, channel or product.  This requires a layer of new development that 'wraps' the legacy systems, and the capabilities created out of the legacy still need to be integrated into that new solution. For example, capabilities in the legacy systems might become service providers to the new solutions.

At the same time, new capabilities are likely to be required since legacy modernization usually entails more than the need to re-skin, or re-process the legacy system. There will be new business requirements that the legacy system didn't address.  Hence, model-based tools can be very useful in terms of:

<strong>a</strong>. Designing and implementing the new process and UI layers
<strong>b</strong>. Creating the services that wrap the legacy capabilities
<strong>c</strong>. Creating both new business functionality, and new components &amp; services to support them
<strong>d</strong>. And finally, assembling it all together into the new solution.

<b><i style="color: #ab0404;">Have you used a model-based tool to help with your legacy? What have been the benefits?</i> </b>

In the next and final question, Lawrence offers the top three mistakes people make with their legacy modernization efforts.

<b>Q.3 What are the top three mistakes people make when addressing their legacy?<!--more--></b>

<img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="LW.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LW2.jpg" width="100" height="150" />

<b>LW: </b>I might have hoped that post Y2K, organizations would have more actively sought to avoid building yet more legacy systems. However, time and again we see organizations doing the following:
<ol>
	<li><b>Creating another legacy.</b> They fail to understand why they have legacy systems in the first place, and just rush into creating another one. They don't understand the requirement for on-going change, nor does the business encourage them to think about it. This could be due to:  a lack of process - i.e. they don't understand how to facilitate change at each stage of the life-cycle; or, stakeholders unwillingness or inability to express requirements for change.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b>Not designing for agility.</b>Agility isn't just a process - as in agile development - agility is also an analysis and design requirement. Ensuring a new solution is better able to respond to change than the legacy systems it is replacing requires appropriate techniques throughout the life cycle. It isn't just a matter of creating a more agile implementation built with finer-grained components and services, but also understanding the business's requirements for agility and identifying those components and services in a way that aligns with that. Conversely, you don't need to over-compensate and waste time providing too much agility where it is not needed - although, that is always going to be difficult to predict...</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b>Not cleanly separating the legacy from the new solution.</b> The two become entwined storing up an even bigger legacy problem for the future. For example, a proper service architecture is not developed that is truly independent of the legacy systems, and so the new solution remains tightly coupled to the legacy. Even though they may use loosely coupled technology such as web services, their content and behavior is just a direct reflection of the legacy system.</li>
</ol>
<i style="color: #ab0404;"><b>What do you think? Do you have any do's and don'ts on addressing legacy that you'd like to share with the community?</b></i>

		<title>ESDC Retrospective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, the OutSystems team attended the <b>Enterprise Software Development </b><b>Conference</b> (<a href="http://www.go-esdc.com/">ESDC</a>) in San Mateo California. This is the first year for this show and, as <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34066">Alan Zeichick notes</a>, it takes up where the old SD West conference left off.  As gold sponsors of the show, we got to both attend the sessions and talk to the conference attendees at the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a> booth. <!--more-->I just wanted to share a few highlights &amp; take-aways from the show:

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="outsystems esdc team2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/outsystems%20esdc%20team21.jpg" width="286" height="248" /></span><b></b>

On Monday afternoon I was pleased to take part in the <b>MythBlasters</b> session and offered the crowd two myths to choose from : <b>#1 "You Cannot Scale Agile in Enterprise IT shops"</b> or #<b>2 "It is less risky and more cost effective to buy a package than to do custom development."</b>

The audience chose to 'blast' the Buy vs. Build myth.  My premise for blasting this myth is based on the success of our customers in <b>building</b> <b>new custom applications</b> for things like <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/AppsAndCustomersCategory.aspx?Category=ByTypeOfApplication/Custom-CRM">customer relationship management</a>, call center management, various HR applications like recruiting, expense management, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/AppsAndCustomersCategory.aspx?Category=ByTypeOfApplication%2fEmployee-Portals">company portals</a>, etc.  I shared the top three ingredients for successfully building vs.<!--more--> buying:  Speed to develop, rapid change and business involvement at each step.  Of course, our customers accomplish this by using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> and an <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Content.aspx?ContentName=8Steps_Overview&amp;FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/ITSolutions/8StepsToAgile">agile methodology</a>.

<i>I think I'll keep Myth #1 for another blog post - but what are you seeing on Buy vs. Build myth? Do you agree that building is a better way to go for many apps where there is a package?</i>

Another highlight: <b><a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a>'s keynote</b> on "<a href="http://www.go-esdc.com/keynotes.html">Responsive Design: Efficiency Through Safety</a>."  This was the first time I had heard Kent speak.  He started off by referencing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yourdon">Ed Yourdon</a>'s work on Systems Design and how it led him to try and distill his own working process for design.  This was the premise for his presentation.  My take-away was that no matter what you do, your design will change. I think we all accept this as fact - especially for application software.  Kent then explained his techniques to reduce the risk when making design changes.  For each of his examples I found myself thinking 'This is not really a problem with the Agile Platform because the TrueChange™ engine will keep you from breaking stuff you did not intend to break, allowing you to move very fast with little risk."  If you are hand-coding, then Kent's four techniques (<a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/ZEICHICK_S_TAKE_CLASSIFYING_SOFTWARE_CHANGES/By_ALAN_ZEICHICK/About_ESDC/34180">as described here by Alan Zeichick</a>) to reduce risk when making change is great advice, but why do that if you don't have to?  BTW, I think Kent would love the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/demos/">Agile Platform</a>.

Since this was a new conference we've been asked <b>who attended and why</b>. Here are some thoughts from the OutSystems team:
<ul>
	<li>The crowd we met included CIOs, IT directors, Enterprise Architects, project managers, analysts and software engineers. Interestingly, a large proportion of the conference attendees represented Enterprise IT (rather than just the ISV folks who usually attend Agile conferences) ...I'd say Agile is definitely going (or has gone) mainstream!</li>
	<li>Many people were there to learn more about Agile and find out if it fit into their world.  They realize that Agile really makes sense, and that they should implement it, but were trying to learn the best ways to do this - both with or without tools to help them.</li>
	<li>The general feeling was that Agile is the growing wave of the present and the future - and many felt they needed to add Agile to their resumes, because it is rapidly growing in popularity.  One attendee stated that he felt Agile was the only "fad" methodology that would last because it actually works and makes sense.</li>
	<li>A few folks told us they were already using some Agile practices, but just had never labeled them as such and would like to get their organizations to officially adopt Agile.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[About one year ago we created the About Agility blog and the first post was on <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">NextStep'09</a>, OutSystems annual user group meeting! It's hard to believe one year went by and we are back posting on <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep 2010</a>.<!--more-->

<p style="padding-bottom:20px;">Here is the video of last year's conference!</p>
<p align="center"><object width="425" height="350" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_ri9d-3PSEE&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_ri9d-3PSEE&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" /></object></p>
This year's conference will focus on '<b>Addressing the last inefficient industry of the 21st century - IT</b>'. We hope you can join us in Lisbon for the event where you will have the opportunity to network with the whole OutSystems community, last year we had over 450 people registered to the event!  But if you can't make the trip to Portugal, don't worry - you can still stay on top of what's happening at NextStep by visiting the About Agility blog before, during and after the conference.

Starting today, we invite you to regularly visit the blog for more information and we will put an extra effort in making sure that here you will find all the latest Conference news. This year we have increased our team of bloggers and promise you constant real time posts that will allow you to feel a part of this event.

For this first post we decided to share with you a sneak preview of what's coming!

Day One of the Conference will include our very exciting keynote speaker -  Massimo Pezzini, distinguished analyst with Gartner Inc.!  Massimo will bring us Gartner's view on methods, technology and architecture that will shape impact your IT efficiency in the next decade. You will also hear from OutSystems CEO Paulo Rosado on the latest news from the company and see a sneak preview of the Agile Platform 5.1.

Day two will include two tracks:
<ul>
	<li>Agile Platform Techniques, for those interested in how to get the most out of our Agile Platform technology, and;</li>
	<li>Improving Performance and Predictability, which will focus on getting the most out of your existing IT operations.</li>
</ul>
We are just finalizing the process of picking the best set of presentations from our customers, partners and R&amp;D team so stay tuned for more info on the detailed agenda.

<blockquote><b>Track ONE: Improving Performance &amp; Predictability</b> - seven presentations are slated for this track that cover lessons learned in the field and case studies from <a href="http://www.bacardi.com/">Bacardi</a>, <a href="http://www.glintt.com/">Glintt</a>, <a href="http://www.turismodeportugal.pt/english/TurismodeportugalIP/Pages/TurismodePortugalIP.aspx">Turismo de Portugal</a>, <a href="http://www.coolprofs.com/">COOLProfs</a>, <a href="http://www.pessoaseprocessos.com/web/guest/">Pessoas e Processos</a>, <a href="http://www.inov.pt/index_e.php">INOV</a> and <a href="http://www.estradasdeportugal.pt/">Estradas de Portugal</a>.

<b>Track TWO: Agile Platform Techniques</b> - seven presentations that focus on best practices and techniques for using the Agile Platform to maximize your ROI. Presented by customers, partners and OutSystems specialists. The presentations range from a comparison of BPMS technologies and the Agile Platform Business Process Technology by AKI Corp; OutSystems &amp; SAP by <a href="http://www.reditus.pt/reditus/en/Default.asp">Reditus</a> and achieving success with Agile in the real world by <a href="http://www.hyfas.pt/">HYFAS</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I just got a chance to look into a new offering at this year's NextStep 2010 conference - Network Breakfast Roundtable discussions. While many of you like to write and share ideas online like I do, there is nothing better than getting to sit face to face and discuss a topic that is top-of-mind for you. This is what these sessions are all about.<!--more--></div>

		<title>Addressing the Last Inefficient Industry - IT!</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/addressing-the-last-inefficient-industry-it.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>"Only 32% of IT projects succeed"</b></span><b> </b></div>
This got everyone's attention as Paulo Rosado, CEO of OutSystems, began his NextStep keynote describing how IT departments are typically viewed by their business counterparts; in a word - <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">inefficient</span></b>.

He was showing a chart by Standish Group to a packed auditorium...that's a pretty awful stat - but why this inefficiency? <!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="pauloday1.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pauloday12.jpg" width="287" height="270" />

Paulo discussed the <b>faults of the waterfall </b>approach and how business change quickly outstrips IT's ability to deliver and, therefore, the rapid decline into <b>misalignment of IT and the Business</b>. IT backlogs pile up and they don't have enough time to respond to new business needs. To add to this, <b>software ages</b> - <i>according to Gartner, enterprise software reaches the end of its life every 5-7 years</i>.

All of this, Paulo asserted, results in the cost of change rising exponentially, both as time passes and as the volume of required change increases.

Paulo shared how OutSystems and its customers and partners are <i>seeing something different from the norm -</i><b><i> Efficiency</i>.</b>

Here are some quotes he shared on how people view OutSystems-driven IT depts:

<b>"IT is very responsive. If it is important, we get a fix in 1 week."</b><b>"Business units now come to us asking to have the project done with that 'OutSystems thing."</b>

He shared a bunch of metrics from the OutByNumbers program which benchmarks OutSystems-based IT depts against each other and against traditional IT depts.  The net net of the slides he shared (which we will upload shortly) - is that in the OutSystems world, the cost of change is both low and stable.<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="cost of change1.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cost%20of%20change11.jpg" width="581" height="389" /></span>
<p align="left">What makes this possible?  The Agile method, in combination with a technology that enables rapid and continuous change.</p>
Drilling more deeply into the reasons for the rising cost of change in traditional approaches, Paulo compared them to the OutSystems approach and explained how we have been able to achieve the opposite of industry norms - and effectively addressing the last inefficient industry.

<b>Four key areas of discussion:</b>

<b>1. Software Interdependency</b> - and the domino effect of change in highly coupled architectures. The TrueChange engine in the Agile Platform alleviates the need to manually check for, and resolve the impact of change.

<b>2. Monolithic Architecture</b> that keep growing and don't allow for reuse. The answer, Paulo asserts, is to create and reuse services as needs evolve and to ensure the software is broken up into smaller piece, that are connected through protocols: supported in the Agile Platform through refactoring and the support for iterative and bottom-up SOA.

<b>3. Broken Application Lifecycles</b> - where the connection between requirements, development, deployment and monitoring is not seamless. These are addressed in the Agile Platform by Embedded Change Technology, 1-click Publishing and Performance Management.

<b>4. Low Knowledge Transfer</b> - when developers leave the team, so does knowledge of the systems they worked on and it takes time to ramp new people. The Agile Platform answer: Model Driven Development.  Here Paulo shared an interesting example to show how models can simplify knowledge transfer: in a real customer's environment 13,157,961 lines of code are represented in the model by 1602 processes, 987 web pages and 745 data structures.  The math is easy: the less elements there are to understand, the easier the knowledge transfer.

Paulo discussed the typical push-back he hears about the model-driven approach: it's only for building toy apps vs. enterprise-class, and problems scaling to real business needs. He looked into the issues of traditional RAD tools, mashup platforms and the combination of the cloud.  Wrapping up with how the Agile Platform was built for scale and to enable the smooth transition from tactical solutions to strategic, enterprise-class.

He closed by saying you could stabilize the cost of software change at a low level, and make IT more efficient by doing the following:
<div align="center"><b>1. Keep architecture fresh + 2. Automate change impact + 3.Address the full software lifecycle + 4. Simplify knowledge transfer</b>.</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This was a great talk, and the number Paulo presented were impressive. Here are some notes I took during the session:
- One OutSystems customer went from <b>0 to 10K function points in 1 year </b>(they built 9 business apps equivalent to a small ERP);
- They delivered <b>172 release</b> (that 1 new release every 2 days) with an average of <b>232 Function Points per release</b>;
- <b>43% of the changes for those releases were related to database changes</b> (imagine the implications on the other layers, especially UI)
- With Model Driven Development, you basically transform <b>13M lines of code into ~3000 modeled elements</b>. This makes knowledge transfer between developers possible

		<title>Managing Software Maintenance with ITIL and Agile</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Professor <b><a href="http://pt.linkedin.com/in/miguelmiradasilva">Miguel Mira da Silva</a></b> of <a href="http://www.inov.pt/e_index.html">INOV</a> and his PhD student, Carlos Mendes, joined us for the second of our morning sessions. INOV is an OutSystems partner and a non-for-profit innovation institute focused on IT, networks and electronics. INOV includes an IT Governance group and a Software Development group that delivers custom web business applications based on OutSystems methodology and technology.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/miguel-de-silva-s2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-767"><img class="size-medium wp-image-767 alignright" alt="miguel de silva s" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/miguel-de-silva-s-300x1742.jpg" width="300" height="174" /></a></span>
<p style="text-align: left;">They presented their research on managing software maintenance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library">ITIL</a> and Agile. First, Miguel talked about how, we in IT, tend to focus on just one of the three aspects of Information Systems - technology - but we forget to manage <i>organizations</i> and <i>people that need to be managed</i>. So, he challenged the audience to consider all three aspects: technology, organizations <i>and</i> management. Miguel asserted that <b>Management</b> is what can really make the difference to success - because people, and the technology they use, are relatively difficult to change.</p>
Since maintenance represents 60-80% of software cost - this is what they decide to focus their research on, but (especially in relation to Agile,) we must remember that maintenance has no scope, no budget and no fixed time frame.

<b>THE RESEARCH QUESTION:</b>  Miguel asked his research team (represented at NextStep by Carlos): while they know how successful they can be using OutSystems for systems development and management, they wanted to know how we could <b>better</b> manage the maintenance of OutSystems-built systems?

In broad terms, they found the answer to be to use the same method for managing an overall company (which are also Organizations + Technology + Management) to manage maintenance - and so they looked to ITIL first and made the assumption that Agile was not appropriate for maintenance (an assumption they worked to dis-prove in their research.)

Carlos explained that since <a href="http://www.itil-officialsite.com/home/home.asp">ITIL</a> is a set of concepts and practices for managing IT services, and that <i>maintenance is a service</i> - ITIL can be used to manage software maintenance. These concepts have been implemented in their Service Manager - a prototype application - which includes a service catalog for managing service lifecycles, Service Level Management to manage SLAs and indicators, and a Request Fulfillment component for managing the request lifecycle.

Service Manager has been piloted in several local Portuguese organizations including PrimeDrinks and Turismo de Portugal - and have achieved success in their pilots.  Hugo Sousa, CIO of Turismo de Portugal was very happy with the results, saying "With INOV we did in 4 months what others in 8 months couldn't. It's not about *ology. It's about the right orchestration. Always remember that a fool with a tool is always a fool."

<b>FINDINGS</b>: When it comes to maximizing the performance and predictability of the maintenance management process, the team concluded that Agile could be used for maintenance, but important differences need to be taken into account: that while development projects have scope, budget and time frames - maintenance does not. Miguel summarizes that their research and pilots have shown that while you should use Agile for development (and not maintenance) and ITIL for maintenance (and not development) - they can be combined into a single integrated management framework.

Miguel closed by offering to the audience that their work is openly available, and while they are an OutSystems Partner, their research results are available to anyone.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Two Agile Projects: Lessons Learned</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kicking off the after-lunch slot the, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_iceland_volcano">now stranded</a>, <a href="http://www.coolprofs.com/">COOL<i>Profs</i></a> team of Ton Koot and Joop Stringer from Holland started things off with a bang. COOL<i>Profs</i> is an OutSystems partner specializing in application development and CA Gen. They talked to us about how to execute an Agile project on-time and on-budget. They shared their experience of their first two Agile projects and used two customer examples to show how things can go; both a project that goes well and as expected, and one that does not.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="joop and ton small.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/joop%20and%20ton%20small1.jpg" width="500" height="215" /></span>The first project they discussed was with <a href="http://www.schuitema.nl/default.asp?action=KlapUitMenu&amp;MenuItemid=217">Schuitema</a>, a new client - the Dutch retailer with 400 stores that each had a server with their own retail system. The project was to use the Agile Platform to add a new web-based mobile front-end to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system">legacy system</a> that had was built with CA-Gen and make available the existing inventory management system on Motorola PDAs (with a Motorola web browser that did not support AJAX) to the store managers and enable real-time inventory control. The intended application was to be a small one, estimated at approximately 700 Software Units.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="hurdle.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/hurdle2.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></span>

The second project was for <a href="http://group.tnt.com/">TNT</a> (global transportation &amp; mail shipment,) an existing client of COOL<i>Profs</i> - to build a new, stand-alone support-request system to enable users to register issues and establish a knowledgebase. Their sponsor was from the business-side and worked with COOL<i>Profs</i> directly to build the new system using the OutSystems Agile Platform. A larger application, this was expected to be a 40,000 SU system.

<img class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" alt="wipeout.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wipeout2.png" width="300" height="237" />

Ton and Joop entertained the audience with two videos. One of an athlete hurdling with great easy and agility. The other, of "Total Wipeout" which is, for those who don't know, a TV show with a lot of different groups competing in a crazy obstacle course - and crashing around with less than agility or grace!

Can you guess which video represented the final experience of which project?

Their experience was that in Schuitema case, they expected easy and speed of a project but faced many surprises and great difficulty; with the TNT project - they expected a harder time with this new customer; but everything went extremely smoothly.
&nbsp;
<b>So, what worked?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Having the commitment of all stakeholders</li>
	<li>Having the <i>business</i> person as your key sponsor</li>
	<li>Direct interaction with the customer - so much so, they felt it was extremely important to be constantly on customer site.</li>
	<li>They strictly enforced all agile principles - daily stand-ups, change requests etc</li>
	<li>Applying common sense.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<b>What didn't work and how to avoid the pitfalls?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Never underestimate the complexity of a system</li>
	<li>Take a good look at the documentation to know in detail what you were working with</li>
	<li>Be careful of proprietary devices (the PDAs they had to use meant hand-coding and big headaches in maintenance)</li>
	<li>Having IT as the key-sponsors alone; get a direct line of communication with the business users</li>
	<li>Be wary of knowing the target technology environment</li>
	<li>Be careful when working with third parties who cannot keep pace with your rate of work and Agile practices.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<b>How to Cope with Challenging Environments: </b>First, the guys prefaced this next section with a warning not to end up back in the waterfall world by trying too hard to know everything up-front.
However, <i>DO do the following</i>:
<ul>
	<li>Start only after you fully understand and feel comfortable that external factors are under control</li>
	<li>Conduct proof of concept against the final architecture and technical environment</li>
	<li>Practice risk mitigation in general</li>
	<li>Convincing your customer that there is a trade-off between time, budget and functionality</li>
	<li>Convince your customer that their on-going participation and understanding is paramount.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<b>Their final key conclusions:</b>
<ol>
	<li>Size doesn't matter (the more successful and straightforward project was in fact the larger one by nearly 10x)</li>
	<li>But, infrastructure does matter! (e.g. a different PDA was presented to the team to be used than the one used for the prototype)</li>
	<li>Don't find yourself responsible for things you cannot control (like third parties or the support of handhelds)</li>
	<li>Be wary of using new technology to change archaic organizations.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Track 1 started with a great presentation by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=20560909&amp;authToken=8Mce&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchindex=3&amp;pvs=ps&amp;goback=%2Efps_sandra+fernandes_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_G%2CN%2CI%2CCC%2CPC%2CED%2CFG%2CL%2CDR_*2_*2_*2_*2_*">Sandra Fernandes</a>, Project Manager of <a href="http://www.glintt.com/">Glintt</a>, that shared an interesting case study of a solution delivered to <a href="http://www.ren.pt/ven/Pages/home02.aspx">REN Trading</a> (a large Portuguese utilities company, part of REN).

The main takeaway of the session was the very positive results Glintt reaped from using an Agile Methodology approach.

Sandra began by explaining REN's business, which is actually very complex - just like most Utilities companies I've come across! Let me try to summarize it: REN is responsible for managing a large array of processes from energy production to CO2 emission allowances.<!--more-->
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right aligncenter" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px;" alt="sandra 2small.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sandra%202small1.jpg" /></span>
For those not familiar with the energy market, keep in mind that energy cannot be stored, so you need to produce what will be consumed, and respond to any production/consumption change in real-time. On a daily basis, you need to collect data, aggregate it and make decisions in real time to ensure the success of your business. The impressive fact that struck the audience was that, before this system was delivered, REN managed most of their operations and calculations using a complex ecosystem of interlinked spreadsheets. Just take a minute to think how that might look like...</p>
Sandra took some time to describe the final solution, giving the audience a feel of how the system actually works. When she explained all the functionality the system offers (which I'm keeping off this post to keep it short) and mentioned it was delivered in 16 weeks, you could see people wondering "how was this possible?"

Sandra quickly answered that question in the next slides: using an agile methodology and the OutSystems Agile Platform!

Some quick project stats:
<ul>
	<li><b>Go live in 14 weeks</b></li>
	<li><b>5 sprints/demos + 1 tuning sprint of 2 weeks</b></li>
	<li>Glintt Team: 1 Engagement Manager, 1 Delivery Manager, 2 developers</li>
	<li>Customer team: 1 Sponsor, 1 Manager, 2 key users</li>
</ul>
Despite the complex project scope and the relatively small project teams (from both the customer and Glintt) and timeline, the project was delivered on-time, on budget and with strong user adoption!

Sandra wrapped up her presentation sharing what she considers to have been the key success factors:
<ul>
	<li><b>Strong commitment and early adoption of the agile methodology by the customer</b> - Glintt actually ran a workshop session with the customer to get them up to speed on the agile methodology and engage them from day one;</li>
	<li><b>Continuous coaching and alignment of expectations</b> - this ensured that as the project evolved, the customer was always aware of the "cost" required to implement features and perform changes.</li>
	<li><b>Early implementation of the most complex business processes</b> - this got buy-in from the customer since they saw, very early in the project, how the main features would work and understood they were actually going to get what they wanted! It also reduced project risk.</li>
	<li><b>Agile Platform's ability to support continuous and fast change</b> - starting with relatively fuzzy scope that is constantly being renegotiated and realigned, means you need to react to change very fast. According to Sandra, without the Agile Platform's support for change, it would have been impossible to deliver such level of change in such a short timeline;</li>
	<li><b>Both teams were highly motivated</b> - seeing a demo with many of the key functionality working after just 3 weeks boosted the customer's confidence of the project's success and the whole project team's motivation.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>"Our objective is that every single project reaches this level of success, and is not seen as an exception, but as the norm. This way IT will no longer be considered 'the last inefficient industry of the 21st century'. This is our goal and we're on the right path." </b></span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The close Track 1 morning sessions, <a href="http://www.turismodeportugal.pt/english/TurismodeportugalIP/Pages/TurismodePortugalIP.aspx">Turismo de Portugal</a> brought a success case of the innovative School Management Solution (SMS).

This was not the average case study presentation: it was a true celebration of success with agile!

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=3783450&amp;authToken=zAbK&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchindex=2&amp;pvs=ps&amp;goback=%2Efps_hugo+sousa_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_G%2CN%2CI%2CCC%2CPC%2CED%2CFG%2CL%2CDR_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2">Hugo Sousa</a>, IT Director for Turismo de Portugal, shared the stage with other 4 project stakeholders,and started the session by playing a video that introduced Turismo de Portugal, their business and needs, sprinkled with live testimonials and images of the School Management Solution being used.<!--more--> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vOZ1hfEAuA">You can check the video here</a>.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DontBeAfraidOfChange12.jpg"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="DontBeAfraidOfChange1.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DontBeAfraidOfChange1-thumb-500x334-3782.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></span>

Hugo explained they evaluated several packages available in the market (both commercial and open source). Their conclusion was that they would either be forced to buy a package that included too much functionality they didn't need or want; or buy a package that used relatively obsolete technology and would be very difficult (and costly) to adapt to their specific needs.

So, at the end of the day, they decided to build it from scratch. Many said they were crazy, but the team knew that building it was the right thing to do - and today they proved they really make the right decision.

The project involved 50 people, from several internal resources (both the Schools, and the Education, IT and Finance departments) and from two implementation partners (<a href="http://www.normatica.pt">Normática</a> and <a href="http://www.truewind.pt">TrueWind</a>).

Francisco Neto, from <a href="http://www.normatica.pt/">Normática</a>, described the challenges they had: breaking away from manual and paper based processes and create a system to manage 16 schools, and be used by 1300 resources (including teachers and staff) and over 3000 students.

The main objectives? To create uniform processes that all schools would follow, to automate manual tasks to improve productivity and reduce lead times, and to optimize all processes during the whole analysis and implementation stages.

For the longer term, their vision is to increase the quality of educational services and the student's satisfaction levels, improve the tourism offers in Portugal, and increase de demand for tourism and hospitality education in the country - and all of this with a strong focus on the environment and sustainability.

Here are some stats about the project:
<ul>
	<li>An agile methodology was used, with <b>6 sprints of 3 weeks</b>;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>They chose 3 week sprints to ensure a bigger throughput of functionality for each sprint demo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>They created around <b>30 applications and components, with +500 web pages and 220 database tables</b>;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>To accelerate the development, they <b>reused 5 pre-built components</b> including "Resources and Meetings Management", "Email Services" and "Charting".</li>
</ul>
João Fernandes (one of the School directors involved in the project) said that originally information was coming from several sources and in different formats. With the launch of a centralized and shared new School Management System, they immediately attained process alignment.

Also, by segregating users by pre-defined profiles, they improved access to the right information for each user, as well as security. According to João, the administrative, financial and pedagogical areas where the ones that most benefited from the launch of the new system but "there is still a lot of potential to explore in this system!" he added.

Maria João, another School Director, presented a couple of slides showing the differences between the processes in 2008/2009 and what they look like today: the key takeout is that everything that once was managed with paper, has now migrated to the new web-based application.

Not only paper and waste are gone, but the whole organization became more "productive" - today they actually handover some of the responsibilities to the students. For example, students are responsible for managing their information and submit their absences in self-service. Another great example is that students don't have to travel to the school they want to join for the enrollment process - they can do it in a school closer to them, saving time and money and simplifying the whole process.

To wrap the session, Hugo asked the audience if they remembered the chart that was presented during Paulo Rosado's keynote yesterday (the example of a company who delivered 10K function points in less than a year.)

<b>"That was OUR chart. Those were OUR numbers. That represents all that we've accomplished" </b>he said proudly. After thanking the entire team he added <b>"We chose the right technology, and in only 4 months we were able to deliver all of this!"</b>

The session ended with even more celebration as Mike Jones (VP of Marketing at OutSystems) handed two Agility Awards to Turismo de Portugal and Normática, for such an innovative and successful agile project.

Congratulations!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Here are some of the questions that were asked after the session:
<b>Q1: What is missing to complete the dematerialization?</b>
Turismo de Portugal explained that they are starting the implementation of a new major release that will include several new processes and integrate with some legacy systems like our ERP, sales system, and the printing system. For example, a student can print his own ID card, or buy and print his cafeteria tickets online.
“What is important for us is to promote educational excellence, and we’ll have many major and minor releases that will deliver continuous innovation. Our IT team wants to receive new features and change requests, and is ready to respond!”

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<b>Q2: What is needed to reproduce this kind of experience in other government agencies?</b>
Hugo Sousa said that “Government Agencies have everything they need. There’s smart people working there, there’s good technology available (like OutSystems) and there are several good service companies. The only thing you need is good leadership and a strong will to get things done.“
<b>Q3: You mentioned government has the people. How many people did you have in your team?</b>
Hugo Sousa, answered by saying “Our IT department had 7 people involved, and outsourced the implementation work [to 2 IT service companies]. The internal resources evolved to a project management position and then interfaced with the service companies and schools.”

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<b>Q4: How much did this cost? </b>
Hugo told the audience that the project cost was around 150.000 Euros (including all software and implementation services.
"The value we're getting out of the system has been much greater than the 150K we spent. In terms of maintenance, we practically have no costs... the system is working and maintenance is residual."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>"Agile is key to overcome difficult customer environments"</b>

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=8311546&amp;authToken=LW-u&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchindex=1&amp;pvs=ps&amp;goback=%2Efps_jos%C3%A9+lu%C3%ADs+ferreira_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_G%2CN%2CI%2CCC%2CPC%2CED%2CFG%2CL%2CDR_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2">José Luís Ferreira</a>, Partner at <a href="http://www.pessoaseprocessos.com/pep_php/">Pessoas &amp; Processos</a> (P&amp;P), took the audience through a voyage to Africa, and shared his adventures in delivering a custom Facilities Management System for Sonangol, the largest oil company in Angola.<!--more-->
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/JoseLuisFernandes2.jpg"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="JoseLuisFernandes.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/JoseLuisFernandes-thumb-250x276-3862.jpg" width="250" height="276" /></a></span>Sonangol had just created a new division called DMI to manage a brand new building that would be used by several companies and divisions of the Sonangol group. What P&amp;P found when they got there was a new division, with a new building to manage, with a new set of challenges every day, and with no past experience - from a IT project perspective, this meant dealing with an extremely fuzzy (not to say non-existing) and evolving scope.

José described Sonangol as a paper-based company - a very hard to change mentality. In fact, even after delivering the new Facilities Management System (called ANGELS), many employees still print out screens and reports for their daily processes and tasks!

The ANGELS system has so much functionality that is impossible to describe in this post. It includes Budget Management (including contracts and suppliers); Organization Management (for over 700 people at DMI); Asset Management (including equipment inventory); Work and Personnel Management.

In a country where the term Agile has not found its way into the business lingo yet, José went on to describe what he calls an Extreme Customer Environment:
<ul>
	<li>The customer is 6000Km away from P&amp;P's office. It might not seem that far, but you need to realize that it takes 2 weeks to prepare a request for a Visa, and 2 more weeks to (eventually) get it. That's 4 weeks just to be able to get on a plane!</li>
	<li>Angola's capital, Luanda, is one of the most expensive cities for foreign business people. Having people stay there for long periods of time would blow away all the project's budget;</li>
	<li>Communications are a daily challenge. Being able to do something so trivial as a Skype call or sending a file via email is really a matter of luck. Too often it doesn't work!</li>
	<li>Finally, getting the hardware you need is a crusade! In one case it took them 15 days to get a computer (not a server in the data-center... a regular PC to use for development!)</li>
</ul>
So how did P&amp;P use an agile approach in such adverse business conditions?

They had to dilute the time-line... <b>instead of using the tradition 2-3 week sprints they decided to have 2 months sprints</b>, for a project time-line of 1 year. "This is certainly no a candidate for an Agility Award project right?" José teased.

Surprisingly, enough, agility was the most important value, the one differentiation P&amp;P had to rely on to ensure success:
<ul>
	<li>It allowed them to <b>cope with undefined and constantly changing business requirements</b>;</li>
	<li>Most questions emerged during demos, where they could <b>get real end-user feedback</b>;</li>
	<li>The <b>project was time-boxed</b>. They had to deliver the solution in a well defined time-frame;</li>
	<li>It provided a <b>framework to continuously negotiate scope</b> for every sprint, and ensure the solution was addressing the right business needs.</li>
</ul>
According to José, using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">OutSystems Agile Platform</a> was critical for the successful delivery of the project, because of its <b>support for change and distributed development teams</b>.

After every sprint demo, they immediately corrected all issues and implement the requested changes - they would only leave the country with the list of new features to be implemented in the next sprint... and start working on the new visa for the next trip in 2 months time!<a href="http://www.pessoaseprocessos.com/pep_php/">

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=14512814&amp;authToken=yMmc&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchindex=1&amp;pvs=ps&amp;goback=%2Efps_pedro+barreto_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_true_G%2CN%2CI%2CCC%2CPC%2CED%2CFG%2CL%2CDR_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2">Pedro Barreto</a>, from <a href="http://www.bacardi.com/">Bacardi Martini Portugal</a>, stepped down from his IT Manager position and took over a truly honest and open stance, sharing his personal experiences with agile methodologies and OutSystems.

He started by quickly reviewing his past (and bad) experiences with Waterfall models, purchased packages and several failed custom built projects. He knew that had to be a better way, and was looking for something new, something fresh, that would allow Bacardi's IT to reach the desired level of responsiveness and agility.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pedro-Barreto2.jpg"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="Pedro-Barreto.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pedro-Barreto-thumb-500x224-3882.jpg" width="500" height="224" /></a></span>
About 2 years ago, when Pedro joined Bacardi, he found a CRM project waiting for him - the company wanted to replace an existing solution that had not been adopted by the sales team.  After looking at existing packages (some of which being used in other Bacardi subsidiaries) he quickly understood that those packages would have the right mix of functionality to effectively support the local business and, worse than that, would not be adopted by sales causing the CRM project to fail again.

Looking back, Pedro considers such a big project to have been a bad choice due to its complexity and track-record. There were high expectations from IT, but on the business side the expectations were really low due to IT's bad reputation ("CRM projects fail all the time".)

As the project evolved, major features were being decided and elaborated during the development phase. Business was not fast enough to test new functionality and deliver requirements for each sprint - development teams were stalled!

To make things worse, a new Sales director was brought on board, and the project was put on hold, 6 months after it was started!

This could have been a disastrous u-turn, but fortunately, the new sales director's energy and vision brought the missing ingredients to the mix. Sprint demos got more participants, more feedback and major features got discussed and detailed.

What were the results? One week after the official roll-out, all features were ready and being used! Today, 60 users from 4 departments are using it (literally) around the clock.

They took 6 months in the first phase, then shifted the focus and in just 3 months, delivered the final solution. "<b>If it wasn't for the ability to change provided by the Agile Platform, we would have never pulled this one off!</b>" Pedro concluded.

An interesting fact was that, while the CRM system was being implemented, they managed to deliver 3 more solutions even if no budget was available:
<ul>
	<li>A Logistics Handling Control to replace a complex XL based process was built in 1 week with 1 developer;</li>
	<li>An IT portal (with a Knowledge Base, Helpdesk ticketing system, Change Management, Backup Control and News) was delivered in 4 months by 1 developer, on his free time;</li>
	<li>A Document Management System (for which there was not IT budget available) was quickly prototyped, shown to the business, and is currently being finalized.</li>
</ul>
The key learning for Pedro is that "<b>as the business starts to understand that IT is able to deliver, they get more involved</b>".

Here's Pedro's tips &amp; tricks to engage the business:
<ul>
	<li>Correct small bugs or misbehavior during demos: while the problem is being discussed during the demo, have a developer implement that small change and immediately show it to the user. You'll get an instant gratification and WOW effect!</li>
	<li>Spoil key users by promptly delivering on their small requests, even if they're not fully on scope (to some extent obviously!)</li>
	<li>Attract other users by showing-off what their peers have gotten from IT.</li>
</ul>
Last but not least, if you want to instill an effective agile practice in your enterprise:
<ul>
	<li>Star with small projects;</li>
	<li>No one will believe you at first;</li>
	<li>No one will have enough time for it;</li>
	<li>Don't quit! You believe in it, so reallocate development efforts while waiting for the business to react;</li>
	<li>Deliver fast and frequently;</li>
	<li>Get users to see the work being delivered;</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Eric Green, CTO at akiCorp - the actionable knowledge company - specialized in BPM. He started the Platform Techniques track with a detailed comparison between the Agile Platform 5.0 Business Process Technology (BPT) with Business Process Management Suites (BPMS).<!--more--></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="ericgreeen3.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ericgreeen32.jpg" width="550" /></span></span></span></div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center; font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">First, he gave us a brief historical overview on BPM, BPA, BPMS over the years, starting with BPM as management approach evolving onto a more solid and fully integrated management and technological foundation. Then he highlighted the solid integration of the OutSystems BPT modeling approach with user work management provided by OutSystems EPA (Embedded Process Automation) at the user interface level, as well as the out-of-the-box BAM (Business Activity Monitoring). All in all, Eric considers that the combination of application development and BPT provides an unrivaled implementation capability for the enterprise.</span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Eric <span style="font-size: small;">shared with the audience his competitive analysis on BPMS and some of the advantages of pure-play BPMS, namely Lombardi, such as the strong business modeling capabilities by business users. Again, Eric concludes that if you consider the application and the business process capabilities together, the Agile Platform has a much broader coverage. "You'll never use BPM in vacuum!" </span></span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">For wrap-up, Eric summarized his observations: </span></p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">BPMS is quite effective at process design, discovery, simulation and analysis, but, less effective in ALM, usability features and development productivity;</span></span></p>
</li>
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Both BPMS and Agile Platform comparably effective at integration with external systems, BAM and business rules;</span></span></p>
</li>
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Agile Platform offers a broader spectrum of technical capabilities in the unified modeling environment with automatic (self-healing) data modeling/binding;</span></span></p>
</li>
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Agile Platform offering can be enhanced with addition of simulation and optimization capabilities and BPA tools (i.e., Lombardi Blueprint);</span></span></p>
</li>
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Agile Platform is simply a more pragmatic and cost-effective implementation platform for many businesses;</span></span></p>
</li>
	<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ultimately, great business value achievable with Agile Platform, especially when BPM is the objective in the context of an overall integrated web app development environment;</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">In Eric's words, it all comes up to the last two bullets. What do you think?</span></p>

		<title>Agile Platform - A glimpse into the future</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/agile-platform-a-glimpse-into-the-future.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<div>Following his keynote, Paulo Rosado introduced Mike Jones, OutSystems' VP of Marketing. You could tell that Mike was really eager to talk, but he started out with a disclaimer. All that is showed (and blogged!) on this session is subject to change. This is still work in progress!<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>With that said, Mike revealed the short term roadmap for the Agile Platform:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>5.1 by late June</b> - Focus on Extreme Productivity</li>
	<li><b>6.0 by the end of year</b> - Focus on User Experience</li>
</ul>
<div>To make a stronger point on 6.0, Paulo highlighted the growing importance of usability on Web Applications. After all, usability has a huge payoff in terms of adoption and ease of learning Web Apps.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mike then announced some exciting things that are going on at OutSystems:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>The OutByNumbers program:</b> The goal of this project is to measure productivity. After all, as Mike put it, <i>"the only way to know if you're being efficient is to measure!"</i></li>
	<li><b>The 5.0 Cloud Readiness:</b> Paulo mentioned that the customers were complaining that with the Agile Platform, it takes less time to build the app than to order the HW! So, OutSystems will provision development environments in the cloud, within minutes!</li>
</ul>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="tutorials.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tutorials2.jpg" width="581" height="328" /></span></div>
<div>Mike then focused on some of the features that will be available for 5.1:</div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Search Engine Optimization:</b> The Agile Platform is being used to build a lot of web sites, and these need to have a high ranking on Google &amp; Bing!</li>
	<li><b>Multiple Databases:</b> Large customers with huge sets of data need support for data isolation, both for security and maintenance issues. 5.1 will support this out of the box!</li>
	<li><b>Embedded Tutorials:</b> In order to get new developers up-to-speed with the platform as quickly as possible, OutSystems will use Video Gaming technology to teach newcomers  how to be productive in a fast and fun way!</li>
	<li><b>Wizards: </b>It is very important to have a 1st cut of the application to show the business as soon as possible. This allows IT to quickly show the business the advantages of a build vs buy strategy. You can tell that Paulo is really excited about the wizards, and the impact they have on a developer's productivity!</li>
</ul>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="shirt.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/shirt2.jpg" width="200" height="363" /></span>
<div>At this point, Mike is teasing Paulo: <i>"Are you just gonna talk about the wizards, or are you gonna show us?"</i>. Paulo's answer? <i>"I can show you, but first I'll take my jacket off. I'm a developer now!" </i>Big round of applause from the developers on the crowd!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So 5.1 is on the big screen, and Paulo is developing an Enterprise Web Application. As he himself said, <i>"I haven't done development in 7 years, and here I am doing a demo."</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>The demo itself was pretty amazing! Starting with an Excel, and using the Wizards, it took Paulo only 8 minutes to create and publish an Employee Directory Web Application. As Paulo was building the application, stars flew across the screen each time Service Studio did its magic! And the audience kept going "ooooohhh"!</div>
<div></div>
<div>For the finale, Paulo showed us a glimpse of 6.0, and the new "Themes" feature. With this, he totally revamped the application to look like Apple's website in a click! Loads of clapping from the audience. But the best was yet to come!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Paulo used the Themes and Wizards together to build an iPhone application! He showed the address on screen, and invited people in the audience to access the application, and use it to call Mike - right there on stage!</div>
<div></div>
<div>The faster to dialer was Marco Navega, who got to go up on stage an won a new iPod! And you know what? He wasn't even using an iPhone, he did it with a Blackberry!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Before leaving the stage, Paulo asked the audience to give the R&amp;D and Product Management team a big round of applause for making all these features possible, and the audience responded with a huge ovation!</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This was one of the most amazing demos I've ever seen performed live.
I work at OutSystems and was expecting something really cool to be shown during this session. But everything I had heard about by the coffee machine in the office was not even close to what I saw being done on stage.
And from the reaction of the crowd, I'm guessing thy were feeling the same...
I was trying to explain what I was seeing on my Twitter account, and I actually missed some of the fun. Is there a video of the demo? Anyone got it on tape?
Thanks

A fem months ago at Solutions Delivery, we have send some feedback that was huge improvement in productivity if we had screen wizards in the service studio, but honestly, i have never dream about the way its being developed.
This is huge!!! Great job!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hugo Matthioli of Reditus spoke this afternoon on OutSystems &amp; SAP complementary solutions. He discussed the strengths of combining the two products and methodologies and how to combine them to extend base ERP functionality into the Intranet of RPA - Rui Pena, Arnaut &amp; Associados, a leading Portuguese law firm. Reditus orchestrates the delivery through its custom development and SAP implementation businesses, offering powerful combined solutions to its customers.<!--more--></div>
<div>First, he explained the challenge for RPA and his team: to deliver a rich intranet application to support document management and enterprise workflows in 4 months, by extending the existing SAP Financials, SCM and Human Capital Management implementation.</div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 20px 0 20px 20px;" alt="hugomatthioli2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/hugomatthioli22.jpg" width="252" height="320" />Next, Hugo explained how the solution was architected to provide the required degree of flexibility: the Agile Platform supporting the Portal layer, providing all user services integrated with SAP via Web Services. At the end, the solution integrated 13 SAP web services to support 17 custom business processes.
<div>Additionally, Hugo explained how to integrate an custom development project using the Agile Platform with an SAP deployment and customization project: by embracing two tracks of development with OutSystems agile methods and SAP's ASAP methodology, iterating the user's interface and stand-alone modules using OutSystems, and focusing later down the road on the SAP integration. That gives the team the required time to bring together the user interface with data integration.</div>
<div>Hugo also introduced Carlos Coelho, CFO at RPA who explained why his business required a tailored solution: custom requirements, enterprise-wide workflows and better management of business performance. "In 4 months we did more than we did in 2 years before having OutSystems and SAP!", he concluded.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Summing up his views, Hugo concluded that OutSystems and SAP have a perfect match when it comes to deploy a new business process, or extend a new one that requires leveraging existing SAP data or process into richer and integrated portals.</div>

		<title>Business Process Technology - Patterns and Best Practices</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/business-process-technology-patterns-and-best-practices.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gonçalo Borrêga, from <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a>, started his session sharing his history with OutSystems BPT: For the last couple of years Gonçalo has been working on a very complex claim handling system, with 708 activities, 501 business rules, and more than 4 million process instances running! And these are processes that run from 2 minutes to more than 2 years!<!--more-->
<div></div>
<div>This claim handling system was refactored from another technology into BPT, using a set of ground rules Gonçalo's team applied.</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Know your process:</b> Do deep &amp; early analysis, with the help of your users.</li>
	<li><b>Aim for simplicity: </b>Make it so you can show the process to your users. They will be interacting with the process via de UI!</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="borrega.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/borrega2.jpg" width="520" height="336" /></span></div>
<div>Gonçalo then highlighted the 3 main features he believes differentiate OutSystems BPT from other vendors' solutions:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Impact Analysis:</b> Process upgrades are possible with the platform! Just do an impact analysis before publishing, and this will help you plan your deployments wisely</li>
	<li><b>The process is close to the data:</b> No need to map the process data to the application data, TrueChange built-in, and an amazing event model are some if the benefits mentioned!</li>
	<li><b>The process is close to the UI:</b> You can place a button in the UI to validate or close activities, and changes are applied to the process in realtime. This allows the UI to guide the users during the entire process.</li>
</ul>
<div>Gonçalo then moved on to share some tips with the audience, based on his experience:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Empower subprocesses:</b> The platform supports creating really smart sub-processes, that can be reused throughout the application.</li>
	<li><b>Use smart labeling:</b> Labels are shown to end-users in his inbox, so making them clear will really help users navigate the application</li>
	<li><b>Don't do cycles:</b> Unless they really belong to the process, cycles shouldn't be used just to build logic.</li>
</ul>
Gonçalo then prepared the audience for a deeper dive into some advanced patterns. He showed these with the help of Service Studio, and demonstrated to the audience some patterns the platform's BPT is capable of.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>In here he highlighted the ability to customize the end-users' inbox, showing screen shots of a very sophisticated inbox used on a particular project.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The session ended with a big round of applause, and some heavy duty QA that showed the audience was really into the problems and solutions Gonçalo shared today!</div>

		<title>Efficiency 2.0 - Application Delivery in the Cloud</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/efficiency-20-application-delivery-in-the-cloud.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Carlos Alves, from <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a>, kicked-off Track 2 afternoon sessions by talking about Application Delivery in the cloud. He got the audience excited right from the start, by stating that a new product offering would be announced.
<div>He started by highlighting the cost, complexity, and lack of speed of application development and testing for large enterprises. Three major factors were highlighted as root causes for this problem:</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Large workforce:</b> lots of resources are needed to develop, manage and deploy applications</li>
	<li><b>High Hardware Costs:</b> ITs need to support lots of workload variations</li>
	<li><b>Lengthy Cycle Times:</b> The time it takes from idea to production is too large<!--more--></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>This leads to slow time-to-market of business critical applications... which in turn, Carlos noted, leads to projects being restarted, delayed, or even canceled.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Carlos moved on to highlight the things that make the Agile Platform a great match for cloud computing.</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Custom Web 2.0 applications: </b>Custom CRM, workflows, intranets, and so on, are currently being built with the platform</li>
	<li><b>PaaS architecture by design:</b> The Agile Platform was built as a Platform-as-a-Service from day one</li>
	<li><b>Automated Application Deployment:</b> UI, logic and data are published with a single click to a centralized server</li>
	<li><b>Centralized test areas and visual debugging:</b> providing the tools developers need to build applications right in the cloud</li>
	<li><b>Continuous integration for distributed teams:</b> giving developers tools for configuration management and version control</li>
	<li><b>Designed for highly scalable applications:</b> As an example, <a href="http://www.fly.com/">Fly.com</a> is running over OutSystems, and standing a large number of worldwide searches per second</li>
</ul>
<div>All these features make an ideal match for cloud computing!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="cloud.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cloud2.jpg" width="520" height="269" /></span></div>
<div>Carlos then started explaining how this works. In a nutshell, the OutSystems platform will run over <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, using the servers and software Amazon provides. This configuration was already used in a distributed team environment and was a huge success! The team included 5 developers in the US and 4 in Portugal.</div>
<div></div>
<div>From an efficiency point of you, using the Platform on the cloud lead to 1.4 times faster publishing times, and about the same time to access the web pages. Carlos warned that the test was a bit unfair, in the sense that the Amazon machines were a bit more powerful, but the point is that huge hardware is cheaper on the cloud!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Carlos then highlighted the advantages of using Amazon hardware, and crossed it with the Agile Platform benefits. All things added, you get:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Intant setup</li>
	<li>Pay-per-hour</li>
	<li>High end hardware configuration</li>
	<li>Windows and SQL Server</li>
</ul>
<div>Carlos then made a huge announcement! You can get all this, for development purposes, for only <b>$0.99</b> per hour! All expenses included! Both hardware, and software.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Carlos then handed the stage to Rodrigo Castelo, also from OutSystems, to show the audience how this works.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rodrigo showed that, by following some very simple instructions made available when you purchase the platform from Amazon, you can have a development environment totally configured in 2 minutes! Amazon then takes about 10 to 15 minutes to have the instance running, but at that point you have a full fledge development environment ready for use! A huge applause from the audience!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The presentation moved back to Carlos, and he explained some of the advantages of this solution:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Distributed workforce:</b> to develop, test and deploy your applications</li>
	<li><b>Flexible Cost Structures:</b> to support different workloads on different times</li>
	<li><b>Instant Provisioning:</b> go from idea to start of development in 17 minutes! No more 3 week waiting period for a new machine!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The audience was really excited with this new offer, and a great Q&amp;A session followed. In it, Carlos further disclosed that the Agile Platform was also tested and runs in <a href="http://www.gogrid.com/">GoGrid</a>, and he invited the audience to pre-register for the cloud offering on the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/cloud">OutSystems web site</a>.</div>
</div>

		<title>Agile Success in the REAL World</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/agile-success-in-the-real-world.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rui Afonso of Hyfas spoke about the key success factors of introducing and succeeding with Agile projects in small and mid-size companies. In comparison, Rui reviewed the distinct challenges presented to these corporations.
<div style="text-align: left;">So, how should one deal with small and mid-size company agile projects? Start by showing value early and often. Secondly, don't overload the customer with decisions. Instead, you should help him and leverage a trustful sponsor.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="ruiafonso.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ruiafonso2.jpg" width="590" /></div>
<div>According to Rui Afonso, it's still quite common to find small companies with "owner mentality", where your decision maker will want to get involved in every decision, yet is not available. When available he'll ask you for everything within the scope of the project. So, the question in everyone's mind was: "How to cope with it?"</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rui Afonso explained why instead of trying to start the project from scratch with all requirements scoped upfront, his team prefers to engage with the customer on a time-limited pilot project. A pilot project is actually a great opportunity to gain customer's trust, understand his business and start participating actively in the decision making process.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In such environments, ScrumMasters (or Delivery Managers) shall pay extra care to remove impediments and roadblocks at any time and work beyond the Scrum meetings and customer demonstrations to build and adapt very early the project scope, but also to coach the stakeholders to go agile.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Moving forward, Rui took the opportunity to present a case study for implementation of an human resources performance evalution solution. He explained how key it was to present the first version of his application in 2 days after initiating the project as a way to better gather requirements with his key users, that had been quite vague until that day!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Furthermore, the extensive use of OutSystems Agile Platform <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/demos/DemoScreen.aspx?Movie=Agile-Management--Embedded-Change-Technology---User-Feedback"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: none;">ECT</span></a> (Embedded Change Technology) allowed his team to collect and turnaround change requests with unprecedented efficiency.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In summary, Rui was very happy to see his application being used right after 3 agile iterations, integrating several back-office systems with major adoption from users. And it keeps changing and adapting every day...</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another great success story of the Agile Platform, Agile Methodologies and extending SAP!</div>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree totally that it is critical to "gain [your] customer's trust, understand his business and start participating actively in the decision making process." I have worked with project managers all over the world to show them how to integrate mind mapping into this process--usually by collaborating with them to build a map of requirements. Rather than blindly accepting initial requirements, the project manager who works closely with the client to build a visual document (AKA a map) of the client's need almost unavoidably has an opportunity to get a better understanding of the client's business, and how decisions are made (and by whom)! You can see a general video of using mind mapping to capture and organize requirements at <a href="http://mapthink.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-conceptdraw-mindmap-to-gather_19.html." rel="nofollow">http://mapthink.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-conceptdraw-mindmap-to-gather_19.html.</a>

<div style="margin: 6px; padding: 0px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; counter-reset: __goog_page__ 0; line-height: normal;">

António Melo of OutSystems, started his session on web applications performance by setting the scene about the several performance concerns that need to be taken into consideration: 1) define quantitative targets; 2) estimate the infrastructure required to go live and 3) evaluate performance and scalability as you move forward.

Moving forward with his presentation, António listed a few issues to consider at each of those stages. One is the data transfer between the browser and the server. <!--more-->Cache is good, but you shouldn't rely too much on it. Browsers will discard it every so often due to their size. Other issue is the dynamic content or so called "viewstate" of applications, which can get really big if you don't care about it. António shown how the Agile Platform does the automated optimization at the code generation level without having to have developer to understand how does advanced web application session management works and think about it on a case by case basis.

António explained how the OutSystems' Agile Platform takes advantage of Service Studio models to identify dependencies between business rules, User Interface and database to optimize a series of items in each running application. If a specific database record or column is not going to be used, why leave it there? The Platform takes care of eliminating waste in runtime!

Using the Agile Platform's Service Center, António showed how to track down any outstanding performance issues that haven't been optimized by the built-in code optimizer, automatically getting analytical information about performance of the application out-of-the-box. Pretty cool!

Additionally, he described how the Platform uses server-side cache, asynchronous logging, log rotation and scheduler throttling to improve performance. He listed several other optimizations done by the Platform, such as database connection pooling, dataset late loading, horizontal scalability, automated indexing and more. All automated by the Agile Platform.

Finally, António presented the audience with some additional real world numbers. One of OutSystems customers was getting 1,100,000 page views per day with 3 servers, increasing to 1,900,000 pages views in only 6 months.

In a nutshell: according to António, before development you shall define your targets and performance requirements. During development you shall include those requirements as you do with business requirements and keep measuring and improving, the agile way! After going live don't forget to keep monitoring performance and act accordingly.

Lessons learned: even if using built-in optimizers, such as those provided by the Agile Platform, please consider performance requirements at the same level you consider business requirements. You don't want performance to impact your ability to do business.

		<title>Refactoring Large Complex Systems with 5.0</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/04/refactoring-large-complex-systems-with-50.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Francisco Menezes, responsible for the Application IT at <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a>, started by mentioning that OutSystems web applications are all built with the Agile Platform. Over the years, this set of applications got rather large, and refactoring become a challenge.
<div>Francisco pointed out that applications should be designed to scale and potentiate reuse, but due to fast business changes and team rotation, applications grow endemically, which is an impediment to have a one shot "perfect" architecture. <!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>Francisco said that he sometimes faces changes from business that demand releases every 2 days, which leads to applications not growing in the most orderly fashion. Another thing that hinders the perfect architecture is the fact that sometimes you need to adapt existing components to fit the existing infrastructure.</div>
<div></div>
<div>At this time Francisco revealed that, from his experience, the 5.0 version of the platform refactors <b>10x faster</b> than 4.2!!! Actually, refactoring turned out to be so easy, his team ended up doing more than initially planned!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Francisco gave a few common scenarios where refactoring is used:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Separate business logic from UI</li>
	<li>Isolate services for reuse (bottom-up SOA)</li>
	<li>Isolate integrations with 3rd parties</li>
	<li>Replace or adopt a component</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="refactor.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/refactor2.jpg" width="529" height="373" /></span></div>
&nbsp;

Francisco them moved on to explain the recommend architecture for OutSystems' internal applications. This is a layered architecture, with the following components:

</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Website orchestration</li>
	<li>Business processes</li>
	<li>Core business services</li>
	<li>Infrastructure services</li>
</ul>
<div>The recommendation is for top layers to consume whatever the layers below make available, but never the other way around. Unfortunately, applications are not always built with this layered model from day one. Sometimes it is simply impossible to know beforehand how the application is going to grow, which makes refactoring even more of a priority.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Francisco moved on to show the tools improved in the Agile Platform 5.0, to make refactoring as easy as possible. These include:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Realtime TrueChange</li>
	<li>Copy &amp; Paste improvements</li>
	<li>Enhanced Find &amp; Replace usage</li>
	<li>Improved Compare &amp; Merge</li>
	<li>New Reference capabilities</li>
</ul>
With these tools, developers can follow the 4 steps to refactoring. For each of the steps, Francisco highlighted the gains he had in productivity just by using 5.0:

</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Isolate and clean the objects to be moved - <b>2x faster</b></li>
	<li>Extract the objects into a new eSpace - <b>5x faster</b></li>
	<li>Generalize the protocol of your new Service - <b>2x faster</b></li>
	<li>Remake references on the consumers - <b>20x faster</b></li>
</ul>
<div>Francisco confided that, although he's talking about 20x faster on that last scenario, he believes sometimes it goes up to <b>100x faster</b>! The new capabilities of 5.0 are really helpful on this scenario!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To prepare the room for the demo, Francisco gave a short explanation of what he was going to show. In a nutshell, the goal is to move Accounts, a part of a component used by several applications, to a stand-alone component.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Service Studio, Francisco took advantage of the new features of 5.0 to isolate, extract, and finally remake all the references to Account! Even with the extra time Francisco took to explain the process, the whole refactoring was done in about 10 minutes!</div>
<div></div>
<div>At one point of the process, TrueChange was showing about 500 errors in the application. Using the new capabilities in 5.0, Francisco healed these 500 errors with a single click! That really impressed the audience!</div>

		<title>Embracing New Business Models with the Agile Platform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The final customer case study of the day, but certainly not the least, was presented by Rui Ribeiro, of <a href="http://www.estradasdeportugal.pt/">Estradas de Portugal</a>. This organization works to fund, maintain, plan and extend the road system throughout Portugal as a public service, and Rui talked about the importance of IT in supporting the changes that the company is undergoing.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="rui ribeiro.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rui%20ribeiro1.jpg" width="250" height="251" /></span>

<b>Their challenge</b>: being an 80-year-old state-owned company that's changing its management paradigm, changing its very business model - because the company needed to find new revenue streams. In order to become more sustainable, they needed to better and more directly address their end-user - the road users. They need to know who their customers are, where are they going, and what do they need from the Portuguese road system. From an IT perspective they needed to have business information online and to interface directly with their business partners.

To this end, they created a <a href="http://www.estradas.pt/">Portugal Traffic site</a> for customers, with real-time access to data about traffic in Portugal, and they are implementing features to communicate directly with their users - using SMS, e-mail, a laptop widget, and others mechanisms. All of this is helping the organization change its image from one of a traditional public organization to a modern and competitive one.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="estradas website.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/estradas%20website1.jpg" width="500" height="274" /></span> <b>Why choose OutSystems?</b> In 2009 they were faced with a huge set of IS issues the first of which was their agility - fundamentally, their ability to adapt to the needs of their new business model quickly. As well as huge number of applications, little integration and silos; the IT team was focused on internal applications which were not web enabled, but unproductive windows and legacy forms. In addition, and probably hardest to change, their internal users saw them as a cost center and not a partner. Rui and team needed to change this viewpoint and be considered as a strategic part of the business.

To do this, they went about choosing a set of preferred technologies and partners and defined a set of architectural stacks to enable this goal. They HAD to do this in order to achieve their future goals and most importantly, they needed to be FAST. This is where OutSystems came in; other organizations like Brisa (another OutSystems client) or Ascendi had already done it, and Estradas de Portugal was behind and needed to move faster and get more competitive.

They started using the OutSystems Agile Platform to leverage their IT business knowledge and build and deliver new web systems rapidly.  Another by-product of adopting OutSystems was that it helped them get closer to their users - yes, the introduction of a new methodology (Agile) enabled them to "break the ice" with the internal customers, delivering value and quickly.

<b>Results after the first year:</b> today they have a huge set of projects running on OutSystems. Financial applications: budgeting, commitment management, payment processing and financial dashboards. Also running on OutSystems; an identity management system, inventory management systems and systems for managing road security.

Rui described their biggest OutSystems implementation to date in a little more detail- a financial and supplier management system. They originally had the Oracle eBusiness Suite in place but suffered the typical issues of a packaged application. So, they chose to build a ring of services around it to support their specific needs and used OutSystems to build a set of applications (budgeting, commitment, payment) - with a sprint/demo every 2 weeks. On Jan 4th of 2010, this portion of the application was released.  The next phase is to extend the application with the goal of communicating more openly and accurately with their suppliers (e.g. supplier request, contracts and evaluations,) and hopefully remove all the phone calls that are currently needed.

<b>Achieving strategic goals:</b> today the Estradas de Portugal IT team is making progress toward their goal of no longer being seen as a cost center - but rather becoming a strategic part of the company.  The applications they have and continue to implement - and in particular, the speed at which they are making change - are making a difference to the way they service their customers and, as a result, the overall perception of the company.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over at <a href="http://www.ebizq.net/">eBizQ</a>, you'll find a newly penned article by OutSystems senior consultant Robert Neri on the topic of<a href="http://bit.ly/ar0vY0"> Agile SOA</a>, specifically looking at how organizations can create a nimble IT structure by introducing Agile technologies and strategies as part of their SOA development methodologies. It's an interesting look at how Agile and SOA can come together to create a 'best of both worlds' scenario and create effective results.<!--more-->

		<title>XDx - Using Agile Development to Support Scientific Research Studies</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/05/xdx-using-agile-development-to-support-scientific-research-studies.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/business/23blood.html">New York Times</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703876404575199931699094978.html">Wall Street Journal</a> recently ran  articles on an important new blood test, called <a href="http://www.xdx.com/allomap/">AlloMap</a>, which was developed by <a href="http://www.xdx.com/">XDx</a>, a cutting-edge biopharma based in California. <!--more--><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="xdxAlloMap.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/xdxAlloMap2.jpg" width="217" height="172" />What's AlloMap, and why is it making headlines? From the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/business/23blood.html">article</a>:

A blood test that analyzes genetic activity could let heart transplant patients avoid many of the invasive and uncomfortable biopsies now used to monitor whether their immune systems are rejecting their new organs, doctors said in a study published Thursday.

The study found that patients who were monitored for rejection using the blood test had outcomes roughly equivalent to those of patients who were given frequent heart biopsies.

It's an impressive development in the area of cardiovascular medicine, and according to one doctor quoted in the article, XDx's AlloMap "will cause a paradigm shift in how we monitor for rejection."

<i>So what does this have to do with agile development or OutSystems?</i>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">XDx used the OutSystems Agile Platform to create the business application it now uses to track and analyze the diagnostic tests required in clinical studies. The application replaced XDx's former Excel-based and manually intensive processes, increasing their ability to study clinical data in a timely manner. Using Agile Platform, XDx delivered its first application to business users in only 6 weeks - including one week of fine-tuning. XDx's story is only one example of the kind of applications that are being built using Agile Platform, but we think it's a pretty remarkable one.</p>

		<title>Is the Custom App Dead?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[OutSystems' own VP Marketing, Mike Jones, recently wrote an article in <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/index.jhtml">Dr. Dobb's</a> on the <a href="http://bit.ly/9BEVd9">"death" of custom applications </a>in theenterprise world - and it seems to have caused a bit of a debate - both in comments on the article and in an off-shoot blog post on the same subject.

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="RIP.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/RIP2.jpg" width="200" height="217" />

The supposed killer?  Software packages.  But are custom apps really dead? Mike's take is that while software packages were once considered the silver bullet of enterprise IT, this is no longer the case.  Agile development practice, coupled with a strong delivery platform, has pushed custom development back on par with off-the-shelf solutions and, in some cases, has made custom apps a better choice than their boxed counterparts.
<ul>
	<li>Read Mike's <a href="http://bit.ly/9BEVd9">original article in Dr. Dobbs</a> and the reader comments.</li>
	<li>Also, check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/a7BsWn">blog post</a> by <i>Ann All of IT Business Edge</i>, and the question she poses; "will Agile development bring back custom software?"</li>
</ul>
What's your experience with custom applications versus packaged software?  Do you agree with Mike? Join the conversation!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/test-center/archive">InfoWorld</a> delivered its <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297">findings</a> after reviewing multiple web development tools.  They looked across five key areas to compile the score; Ease of Development, Extensibility, Portability, Documentation and Value.  The products reviewed were Alpha Five Version 10, Iron Speed Designer 6.2.1, Visual LANSA for the Web 11.5, OutSystems Agile Platform 5.0, and MLstate OPA S2 Beta.<!--more-->

Needless to say I was very happy (but not really surprised) to see that the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297?page=0,4">Agile Platform's</a> Service Studio performed top of class.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="infoworld scorecard.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/infoworld%20scorecard1.jpg" width="400" height="403" /></span>Now, if we can just get InfoWorld to do a review of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">full life cycle aspect of delivering and maintaining a web application</a> - that would change the landscape of the review considerably and I know we would rock again.

<i>Everyone who is a fan of the Agile Platform please take a minute to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297#talkback">go and share your experience</a> with the InfoWorld readers!</i>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There has been a flurry of activity in the OutSystems offices as we've been setting up <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/askrymer">new web pages</a> for an experiment we're conducting with <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/research">Forrester Research</a>'s <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/analyst/john_rymer">John Rymer</a>. It's a kind of social consulting experiment if you like - where OutSystems is sponsoring some consulting time with John, and inviting anyone (via Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) in the IT world to ask him questions on the topic of  "<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/askrymer">The Future of Enterprise Applications</a>."<!--more-->

The idea is simple:

1) <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/askrymer">Post your question</a>. You can post as many questions as you like on the subject - or sub-topics like cloud, mobility, tools, agile... (and don't forget to retweet it and follow the hashtag <b><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23AskRymer">#AskRymer</a></b>)

2) John will select up to 10 questions to answer, and we will meet with him next week during the <a href="http://www.forrester.com/events/eventdetail/0,9179,2431,00.html?sTab=overview">Forrester IT Forum</a> in Las Vegas to record his answers for you. (BTW, if you're attending IT Forum, stop by the OutSystems booth and say Hi!)

3) We will post the videos of his answers to the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/askrymer">project webpage</a> (and here, no doubt) and then tweet, blog, shout, and jump up and down to tell everyone they're ready!

Both John and the OutSystems gang are very excited to see how this experiment works out. We believe that the online IT community is very vibrant and sure to come up with thought-provoking questions!

So - what questions do you want to ask John Rymer about the Future of Enterprise Apps? <i><b><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/askrymer">Ask him now.</a></b></i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's no better way to try technology out than to build a real-lifeapplication with it. Taking an idea for a product and developing it is a great way to understand the value and shortcomings of any new tool.

This is exactly what Justin James decided to do with the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">Agile Platform</a> and he's journaling his experience of developing his new web app, Rat Catcher, in a series of diary entries that are being published in <a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/">Tech Republic</a>. You can check out his first set of entries: <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2503">Diary #1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2533">Diary #2</a>.

<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="developer-diary2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/developer-diary22.jpg" width="232" height="170" /></span>

The following is an excerpt from Justin's latest experience using the Agile Platform in <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2564">Diary #3</a> where he starts by saying:
<blockquote>"The Agile Platform is composed of four major pieces: Service Studio, Integration Studio, Service Center, and the Agile Network. I spend nearly all of my time in Service Studio, which is where the application and data modeling occur, as well as application debugging. You can also publish your application to a server from Service Studio. While Service Studio is an IDE, it uses a paradigm that is very different from any IDE that I have ever used.  The three major functions in Service Studio are data modeling, process modeling, and screen design."</blockquote>
He goes on to describe his first reactions, some of the difficulties he encountered, and how he managed to change his developer's paradigm to really make the most of the Agile Platform. Although a bit technical for some of our business minded readers, I think our developer base will find these articles very interesting.

I'll be curious to see what Justin thinks of version 5.1's new functionality (watch this space for more info on this upcoming release!) For example, the new wizards that will help build the screens from the data model even faster. Justin also hits on an advanced detail when he talks about the "late load" AJAX component, which admittedly was a bit of an odd pattern, and something our developers have fixed in 5.1.

<b>So, this goes out to all of you professional developers;</b> please share your experiences and tell other readers what you like and don't about working with the Agile Platform.  What do you think of Justin's take on the platform? Does it match your initial experiences?

		<title>Extra! Extra! R&amp;D Team Expelled From Ivory Tower.</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2010/06/wisdom-of-crowds-crowdsourcing-application.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's a known fact: R&amp;D engineers are part of a special breed of IT professional who usually live behind closed doors, in a high-security area of the software vendor's ivory tower.

This means information about what's needed in their products comes from marketing folks and nagging sales reps (yikes!) and the feedback is usually shielded behind an online form that "takes only 2 minutes to fill."

This is all wrong!

<!--more-->

&nbsp;

<img style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ivory_Tower_by_Hideyoshi2.jpg" width="220" align="right" />

Opening up the communication channel between R&amp;D and the rest of the world is the best way to find out what users really need, understand how they are using the products you build and what they think is missing.

The problem with an open communication channel is that it also needs to be manageable. Setting up an email account where users can send in their suggestions is a recipe for email flooding; it will require massive manual work to get all feedback and ideas into a workable wish list; it's difficult to provide feedback, and will probably become unmanageable very quickly. So, how do you solve this problem?

<b>Give a warm welcome to crowdsourcing! </b>

The concept is simple; let a community of professionals interact, share their thoughts, vote and comment on other people's ideas. As participation grows, bad ideas will be filtered out, good ideas will bubbled to the top and a lot of great feedback on what's working (or not working) will become crystal clear. The ways this idea actually work have been published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">James Surowiecki's best-selling book Wisdom of the Crowds</a>.

This concept led us, at OutSystems, to create a <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/wisdomofthecrowds/">Wisdom of the Crowds application</a>; one that we could use to trigger, nurture and manage this creative process. We built the first version in just 5 days using the Agile Platform, and started using it internally to gather feedback and ideas from our own employees.

We added some functionality, tuned the usability a bit, solved some minor bugs... and then made it available to our user community. Every community member can now add their own ideas, comment on other user ideas or simply vote on the ideas that they find more valuable.

<b>Here's what we achieved in the first two weeks: </b>

<b>388 users have contributed 189 ideas with 537 comments and 1719 "likes" </b>(votes) by the community. <b>Ten ideas have already been implemented</b> and have been made available in the latest version of the Agile Platform. <b>Thirteen ideas are set for implementation in the next release</b>.

During the time it took to write this post the idea count rose to 216, with three additional ideas implemented and sixteen more coming soon!

If you're a member of the OutSystems community, you can <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/wisdomofthecrowds/">access the Wisdom of Crowds here </a>and participate in the online brainstorm.

PS: <b>This app is free</b>, and can be deployed on any Agile Platform installation (including the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">free Community Edition</a>). If you'd like to use the Wisdom of Crowds app in your company <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/goto/contact-outsystems">contact us </a>and we'll give you the pointers on how to set it up.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/05/asking-forresters-rymer-future-of-enterprise-apps.html">A few weeks back</a>, we introduced you to a Social Consulting Experiment that we were conducting with <a href="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a>'s <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/analyst/john_rymer">John Rymer</a>. We launched a <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/futureenterpriseapps/">new web page</a> and invited anyone who wanted to submit a question for Rymer on the topic of "<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/futureenterpriseapps/">The Future of Enterprise Applications.</a>" We called it an "experiment" because, when we launched it we weren't sure how it would turn out - we didn't know how many people would submit questions, or what the response would be on sites like Twitter.<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="SocialExperimentsml.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/SocialExperimentsml2.jpg" width="150" height="166" />

Fast forward a couple weeks, and we're happy to report that our Social Consulting Experiment was a mega-success! More than 60 people <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/futureenterpriseapps/enterpriseappsquestions.aspx">submitted questions</a>, proving that there is a lot we need to sort out with regard to the future of enterprise applications, and dozens upon dozens of folks chimed in via Twitter using the #AskRymer hashtag.

John Rymer has sorted through <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/futureenterpriseapps/enterpriseappsquestions.aspx">all of the questions we received</a>, and he selected the nine he thought best spoke to the future of enterprise applications. We caught up with him during the Forrester IT Forum and got his responses on video. Here is a recap of the questions Rymer answered:
<ul style="padding-bottom:20px;">
	<li>What will be the impact of fully web-enabled mobile devices and touch-devices on Enterprise application development?</li>
	<li>How prevalent do you see the use of BPM and ETL tools as opposed to corporations utilizing in-house developed processes to integrate applications or services for SOA? Where do you see the market trend headed in today's economy?</li>
	<li>How do we deal with our existing application portfolio?</li>
	<li>What percentage of future apps will be developed using agile technologies? Applicability of Agile to large scale enterprise apps?</li>
	<li>Will Enterprise Applications be hosted in the Cloud or on premise - what's the selection criteria? What's next after the Cloud?</li>
	<li>Will the next generation of Enterprise apps (both built and bought) be disposable?</li>
	<li>Do you think Enterprise Applications will work like internal social networks for companies?</li>
	<li>What are the key upcoming innovations that will change the face of enterprise applications?</li>
	<li>Will agile organizations with agile tool kits be able to surpass COTS vendors in delivering on-target business applications?</li>
</ul>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="Askrymer LP2.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Askrymer%20LP21.jpg" width="487" height="356" /></span>To see his answers to these questions, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/futureenterpriseapps/">check out this page</a>. We're excited to have had an opportunity to facilitate this conversation on the future of enterprise applications, and hope you've found it useful as well.

Let's continue the conversation about the future of enterprise applications here on this blog. What do you think? Do you have any lingering questions that we weren't able to answer during this experiment?

As Justin said, "I was not worried -- after all, I knew that Integration Studio would let me hook up my application to this code."

<!--more-->

I thought I'd share some key learnings and highlights from these two journal entries.
<span style="font-size: 1em;">(BTW, If you missed the previous entries of Justin's diary check this <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/05/a-developer-diary-justin-james-on-the-agile-platform-service-studio.html">previous post</a> on the About Agility blog.)</span>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0pt auto 20px;" alt="JJ4 pic.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/JJ4%20pic1.jpg" width="508" height="255" /></span><b>Integrating Web Services</b></div>
<div>Turns out Justin's code uses some advanced patterns, and although Integration Studio did its part and "was successful at a technical level," Justin opted to use another form of integration: Web Services. As soon as Justin made his code available as a web service "it was a cinch to point Service Studio to the deployed Web service." Well, Justin did find a little bug, but this was a great opportunity for him to connect with the OutSystems <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Network/">community</a> for help and guidance, and we're really happy that he thought "it was a great experience"!</div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b>Deploying Rat Catcher</b></div>
<div>With all the pieces in place, it was now time to deploy the first public version of <a href="http://ratcatcher.titaniumcrowbar.com/RatCatcher/">Rat Catcher</a>. Justin has a pretty elaborate infrastructure, and the experience he documents in the diary entry will surely help people with similar setups. Nice to hear that installation was a breeze, since "the team did an amazing job with version 5 and getting the install to be smooth and easy."</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b>Doing things the hard way - but learning...</b>
After configuring the Agile Platform, all that was left was deploy the application. Justin actually did this the hard way; he deployed one component at a time... but I was really happy to see that he learned all about the OutSystems solutions, so he is now able to quickly move all components to production at once, while keeping version records so he can rollback to old versions if needed.</div>
<div>I'm looking forward to the next five installments to hear about his continued experience with the platform, and hope you're following along too. What do you think of Justin's experience so far?</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/06/jjdiary-application-integration-and-deployment.html">Rat Catcher deployed in public Beta</a>, it was now time for <a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/5213-6257-0.html?id=2926438&amp;tag=workspaceTop;wsBannerLeftCol">Justin James</a> to start gathering user feedback on his application. To do this, Justin installed and configured OutSystems' Embedded Change Technology (ECT.) You can read about his experience in his <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=2772">latest diary entry</a> in <a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/">Tech Republic</a>.
<div><!--more--></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/etc_button2.png" alt="etc_button.png" width="173" height="50" />
<div>"ECT is a technology that allows the end users of my application to place a pinpoint on the working application, type a text message, and hit a button to submit their feedback. In the back-office, I then receive the screenshot of the application web page with the user's pinpoint plus the text message. (You can see a <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/#capture-contextual-feedback" target="_blank">quick demo of the ECT</a> in action.)"</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>Getting everything ready for ECT</b></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>ECT makes use of Enterprise Manager, a solution provided by OutSystems that centralizes all common administration tasks such as users, roles and the existing applications' back-offices. Installing it is easy. Just <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkSolutions/ProjectDetail.aspx?ProjectId=64">download it from the OutSystems Network</a> and use the Solution Pack Tool to 1-Click publish the solution. "Next, you repeat this process, but with the ECT solution; <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkSolutions/ProjectDetail.aspx?ProjectId=7">download ECT here</a>, open it, and click 1-Click Publish."</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>Configuring ECT</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Justin provides a great step-by-step explanation in his article on how to configure ECT in Enterprise Manager, and moves on to using the ECT configuration wizard to customize its behavior. "The wizard is pretty self-explanatory from here. One thing to keep in mind is that you may not want to add ECT to every eSpace on a production server. Then again, you might want to after all!"</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>Collecting feedback</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>With ECT up and running, users started to send feedback about RatCatcher. As Justin puts it, this "feedback system is far better than receiving the typical email from a user where they have a hard time describing what the problem is. It can be used for bug reports as well as suggestions for improvements."</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>"While this is the type of feedback that could be given through email or a trouble ticket, ECT's ability to show me exactly where on the screen the user had a problem is extremely useful. In addition, it functions as a simple issue management system."</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>One point Justin mentions is that he might have "to find a way to educate users about ECT". ECT is very discreet and "the bottom right is the least viewed part of the screen." This was actually a design decision we made at OutSystems. Although we want ECT to be ever-present, so users can submit feedback whenever they want, we don't want it to get in the way of the application.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope Justin keeps getting excellent feedback from his users on RatCatcher, and I'm sure the app will continue to get better and better! In the meantime, we'll be waiting for the next installment of the Developer Diary!</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Stanley,
ECT is used to gather user feedback, right from the application. You can see a video of ECT in action at the following URL:
<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/enterprise-platform/#/agile-platform/enterprise-platform/troubleshooting/user-feedback-gathering/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/enterprise-platform/#/agile-platform/enterprise-platform/troubleshooting/user-feedback-gathering/</a>
In terms of side effects, ECT only adds a bit of html and Javascript to each page, so it's pretty lightweight.
Another side effect developers sometime fear is having too much feedback. But ECT can be configure to only show up to certain users and in certain apps, so that's easy to control.

		<title>Discussing Agile Platforms and Tools</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Last Monday I had the pleasure of participating in a <a href="http://www.sogeti.com/">Sogeti</a> event dedicated to Agile Platforms and Tools. The event was organized by Samuel Ranzato and it was split into three talks: one about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us">Visual Studio 2010</a>, presented by Clemens Reijnen from Sogeti; one about the <a href="http://jazz.net/">Rational tools</a>, presented by Ton van Velzen from IBM; and one about the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">OutSystems Agile Platform</a>, presented by myself.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="sogeti.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sogeti2.png" width="200" height="410" />
<div>Both the Visual Studio and Rational tools presentation focused mostly on project management, and the life-cycle of issues and change requests. Some tools were shown that help developers keep track of what they have to do, and what they need to test.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead of going for Project Management, I decided to take a different approach and focused on the tools that help developers do actual Agile development. Time was short, so I picked four key aspects of a project we believe are fundamental to ensuring project success when going Agile. These four points were based on the more than 600 Agile projects OutSystems has delivered, and for each, I demoed aspects of the Agile Platform to show how we can help:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Time to market:</b> For agile to work, you need to not only show working software, you also need to put it into production. The Agile Platform's visual environment ensures development that's fast and accurate; while 1-Click Publish enables work to be moved to production without a hassle.</li>
	<li><b>Flexibility to change:</b> Also paramount to Agile is being able to respond to customer requests quickly. TrueChange<sup><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TM</span></sup> gives developers the trust they need to change the application without fear of breaking something else. To gather feedback from the end-users, ECT is the tool of choice; allowing end-users to pinpoint the exact part of the application they would like to change.</li>
	<li><b>Full-Control:</b> Developers need tools that provide them speed of delivery, but being able to control the end result is also mandatory. During this section I presented Service Center, the Agile Platform management console, and gave a quick overview on how to monitor the platform for performance and troubleshooting. I also gave a quick overview of how to control security and the deployment process.</li>
	<li><b>Productivity:</b> I started this section by explaining that it is important to have something to show the customer regularly, even if it means a bit more work for the developers. With this in mind, the new version of the Agile Platform includes the new IntelliWarp<sup><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TM</span></sup> technology. This allows developers to build fully working first versions of an application in minutes! This first cut can then be presented to end-users and adjusted based on their feedback.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>In the end I was very happy with the reaction of the 40 odd people that were in the room! I had the chance to talk with some of the attendees after the event, and I was really glad the Platform had once again made a great impression.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My only regret was that I didn't have more time to talk some other Agile challenges. If you were doing such a talk, what Agile challenges would you pick?</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At OutSystems, we love our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform#What+is+the+Agile+Platform">product</a>. We honestly believe that it is something that truly makes the lives of IT people better. Which, in turn, has made <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies">our customers</a> more successful. We've seen it work over and over and we try and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Network/ViewFreeContent.aspx?FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Network/Home/Help%20us%20Spread%20the%20Word">tell everyone</a> we can about it, but it sometimes sounds too good to be true. However, the <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=1216">word is spreading</a> among the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/Forum_View.aspx?ForumName=Technology+%26+Integration&amp;ForumId=25">developers</a> and we're seeing more and more people<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download"> try it</a> out for themselves.   And we love that.<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="ILUV-1.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ILUV-12.jpg" width="175" height="71" />

<b>What we love even more</b> is when we hear from you, our customers, about how much you love the Agile Platform too. This note is from one such customer who I was emailing with about being a reference for an upcoming press launch - and I just feel compelled to share it.
<blockquote style="color: #003377;">"I live and breathe OutSystems.

I love it... I wish I had discovered OutSystems years ago...

Let me give you a little background...

I was in the midst of creating the current application we are working on (in a competing tool,) when it came across my desk that I needed to create another system for our new online school that's scheduled to open in the Fall. Well, I needed to make this one happen fast, and it would have taken far too long to create in the existing tool.  So, I started searching the web for a faster way. I downloaded and tried two other products before I found OutSystems - both were completely unsatisfactory. They did not give me full control. Then, after probably another month, I stumbled across the OutSystems web page, and I'm very happy to have found it. With the Agile Platform I get complete control over the application, and can see and work with the code visually.  I was able to create a live application for the online school in no time.  The Agile Platform is so good that after creating the application for the online school, I wanted to scrap my current application for our brick and mortar schools and immediately started development for our brick and mortar application on the OutSystems platform.  The speed and ease of programming is what it's all about.

So, I am glad to tell anyone about OutSystems. I think its a great company, great people, great platform.

Thanks
Dan
Dan Stueck, vice president of IT for Faith Educational Ministries.</blockquote>
If you don't believe us - believe Dan. We think the Agile Platform is truly a better way to build, change and manage your web business applications.

OK, getting off my soapbox now and on with the day ;)

Have you used the Agile Platform? What do you think of it?

		<title>The Departmental Web App - From Niche to Mission-Critical</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's no pattern for innovation in an enterprise - while R&amp;D might be responsible for driving new products, someone in logistics or facilities might think up the multi-million dollar selling feature as opposed to a product-design PhD.  The same goes for innovation with corporate IT - new applications aren't always driven by developers but often by the specific necessities of a certain business unit, whether it's sales, HR or management.<!--more-->

These applications often start out as lowly Excel spreadsheets, passed around via email or on a shared drive within a division.  Then, someone internally with passable coding skills or maybe a sympathetic member of the IT team turns this spreadsheet into a low-level Web application, allowing it to be shared easily across the division.

The next stage of evolution occurs when someone higher up in IT or on the management team sees the app in action and envisions something greater.  Maybe the application could revolutionize the way the company tracks prospects internally or perhaps the app is a game-changer for the whole industry - they don't quite know yet.  What they do know, however, is that the application, once specific to a single department, needs to be standardized for the business as a whole.  Now IT's headache begins.

So how do you take what was once an Excel spreadsheet and turn into a standardized IT process?  It's elementary...if you are using the Agile Platform.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dBr7grYl5EM?feature=player_embedded" height="405" width="600" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
It's not just about turning an Excel spreadsheet into an application - plenty of point-and-click tools can do that.  The real problem lies in maintaining this application as it evolves into a strategic business tool - and the Agile Platform can help.  Business IT isn't static - ever - so you need a development platform that can help you maintain, change and evolve not only your newfound mission-critical applications but also your old warhorse commoditized IT applications.

What to know more?  Check out our video series on turning Excel spreadsheets into Web applications.  Then, if you think it our approach is interesting go do it yourself by downloading the free Community Edition of the Agile Platform and following the first tutorial.  I think you will find it amazing what you can do with the Agile Platform.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's no pattern for innovation in an enterprise - while R&amp;D might be responsible for driving new products, someone in logistics or facilities might think up the multi-million dollar selling feature as opposed to a product-design PhD.  The same goes for innovation with corporate IT - new applications aren't always driven by developers but often by the specific necessities of a certain business unit, whether it's sales, HR or management.<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="text-align: center; float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" alt="what if sticky.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/what%20if%20sticky1.jpg" width="190" height="199" /></span>
<div>These applications often start out as lowly Excel spreadsheets, passed around via email or on a shared drive within a division.  Then, someone internally with passable coding skills or maybe a sympathetic member of the IT team turns this spreadsheet into a low-level Web application, allowing it to be shared easily across the division.</div>
The next stage of evolution occurs when someone higher up in IT or on the management team sees the app in action and envisions something greater.  Maybe the application could revolutionize the way the company tracks prospects internally or perhaps the app is a game-changer for the whole industry - they don't quite know yet.  What they do know, however, is that the application, once specific to a single department, needs to be standardized for the business as a whole.  Now IT's headache begins.
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">So how do you take what was once an Excel spreadsheet and turn into a standardized IT process?  It's elementary...if you are using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object width="500" height="340" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zk5voxZFh9E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="500" height="340" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zk5voxZFh9E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Video 1: How to turn an Excel spreadsheet into a web app</b></p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">It's not just about turning an Excel spreadsheet into an application - plenty of point-and-click tools can do that.  The real problem lies in maintaining this application as it evolves into a strategic business tool - and the Agile Platform can help.  Business IT isn't static - ever - so you need a development platform that can help you maintain, change and evolve not only your new found mission-critical applications but also your old warhorse commoditized IT applications.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Annually, on the 256 day of the year, developers worldwide celebrate "<a href="http://www.programmerday.info/">Programmer Day</a>"! This was a surprise to me but I was ready to join the festivities when I got the invitation to present at an event organized by one of our customers, <a href="http://www.cgd.pt/Corporativo/Historia/Pages/Historia.aspx">Caixa Seguros</a>. With a group of over 300 developers this company's IT management decided to celebrate this special day with an event dedicated to Development Practices, Innovations and Challenges. <!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>My presentation was focused on how the Agile Platform's latest version lets you build custom web applications faster than imaginable - what I like to call 'Warp' development. To show how fast you can have a full fledge application running using the Agile Platform, I actually built <b>a complete app in 45 minutes</b>... before a live audience!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="progday-rsc.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/progday-rsc2.png" width="508" height="191" /></span></div>
<div>The application included a bit of everything. Here are some of the things I did during the presentation:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Created a new app from scratch</li>
	<li>Built the initial data model from an Excel file along with all the needed logic to transfer the Excel data into my new application's database</li>
	<li>Created the necessary UI to list and edit the contents of my new database. All Ajax enabled, of course</li>
	<li>Customized the look of the app (well, just a bit, because my design skills aren't that great!)</li>
	<li>Integrated my new application with an external database and created the needed UI to list and edit one of its tables. Form validation included.</li>
	<li>Added functionality to an external database table! This was a products table, and I added a product image... without changing the original database!</li>
	<li>Related my applications 'local' DB with the external database and created a master detail view, including pop-us to edit the data.</li>
	<li>Obtained data from an existing Web Service and showed it in my new app</li>
	<li>Then, I realized the Web Service was a bit slow, so I checked that this was in fact a problem and added a cache to fix the problem.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I actually did a few more things, but you get the point.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the end, I was really happy with the way the audience responded to the presentation. They seemed really impressed with both the development speed and the quality and robustness of the application that was built right in front of their eyes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And you know what's the best part? You too can do all this in 45 minutes or less! <b>Try it out!</b> <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">Download the community edition</a> and check the first tutorials. In no time you'll be building your own apps at 'Warp' speed!</div>
<div></div>
<div>How about you? Were you aware of the Programmer Day? How did you spend your Programmer Day?</div>

		<title>Developers &amp; Processes: A topic for Programmer Day 2010</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Following <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/09/celebrating-programmer-day-with-warp-development.html">Rodrigo's last post</a> on Caixa Seguro's <a href="http://www.programmerday.info/">Programmer Day</a>, I would also like to share with you my session on OutSystems' Business Process Technology. The Caixa Seguros team relies pretty heavily on Business Process Management, and they were eager to learn more about our capabilities and experience!</div>
<div>As such, I was pleased to show them how OutSystems' approaches with the application of BPM technologies and implementations for their specific industry: Insurance - Policy and Claims handling.</div>
<!--more-->
<div></div>
<div>I started by presenting some common concepts we felt were important to address with our BPM approach in the Agile Platform, we call this Business Process Technology or BPT for short.  The key concepts are:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Long lived processes:</b> requiring process instances to be upgraded as new laws, conventions, or procedures are brought in.</li>
	<li><b>Strong cohesion with line-of-business applications:</b> processes are always supported by a business application (or more than one), and this application should work seamlessly with the process.</li>
	<li><b>Big benefits in the end: </b>processes allow every organization to increase operational performance, especially those with clear procedures in their activity. Just getting everyone to know what they're supposed to do improves performance dramatically; according to Gartner, simply having the workflow users should follow on the wall leads to a 12% improvement on productivity. The set of monitoring tools and KPI collection provided by BPM engines brings focus on the need to optimize, and provides leads on how we can optimize it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="BAM_Screeshot.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BAM_Screeshot2.png" width="508" height="140" /></span></div>
<div>The next step was to point out the main challenges faced when setting up a BPM initiative to work with an existing - or new - set of applications that support the same goal. From real field experience, we identified the following set of challenges as the most relevant:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="BPM_Glasses.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/BPM_Glasses2.png" width="150" height="111" /></span>Separation from User Interface:</b> having a process that redirects users to perform manual activities on an application is troublesome for the single fact that they live and are implemented in a separate environment from the application.</li>
	<li><b>Complex API integration:</b> the requirement to plug-in a process' inbox to an application and having the application ignite and advance the processes requires usage of the engine's API, which are not well integrated with the application and are usually hard to extend by the application developers.</li>
	<li><b>Intermediate domains:</b> When processes and applications are supported by different platforms, they still need to share data between them. This leads to non-business related and error prone developments of intermediate data dictionaries, being produced and consumed by each other. When either the application or the process change, these dictionaries also need to be refactored.</li>
	<li><b>Upgrading existing processes:</b> as process definitions change, thousands or millions of running process instances need to be upgraded to the new definition.</li>
	<li><b>Distinct life-cycle between application and process:</b> This leads to inefficiencies in both the application and the process, and can even lead to inconsistencies in the several releases integrations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>With this in mind, I picked a real application used for project management and did a live demo creating a process live during my presentation. The fact that in the Agile Platform, our BPT is implemented as a layer on top of the application removes all the problems mentioned above. While the process is being built, the Agile Platform's <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/true-change/">TrueChange</a> engine detects changes in the entity model and fixes them immediately throughout the process, discarding the need for the tiresome task of creating intermediate data dictionaries. It was also clear that having the process near the application allows doing a lot of neat things, such as a chat like interface where a user leaves his comments on an activity and reassigns it to another user, all in the context of a common application interface.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During the session I showed the audience how business users could check the performance of the just created process via the Agile Platform's built in Analytics application. Right in the session I demonstrated how you are able to immediately provide process feedback using our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/change-management/">Embedded Change Technology</a>. During the session I actually implemented the feedback, and made a change to the process right on the stage. The change required me to upgrade the process, which brought up the clear advantages of having an integrated Impact Analysis before putting new versions into production. This allows operations teams to easily measure the impact of changes in the process, before they are actually deployed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>By the end of the presentation, I believe everyone saw the advantages of having a platform that fosters a common development life-cycle between application and processes. This makes it much easier to build a process that leads the users through their tasks in the application, definitely bringing the Business and IT together in one same purpose: business performance.</div>

		<title>Van Ameyde wins BPM and SOA Innovation Award... with OutSystems!</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2008, <a href="http://www.vanameyde.com/">Van Ameyde</a> - an international insurance claims manager from the Netherlands - came to the conclusion it needed to optimize their claims handling process in order to provide customers with the best service levels in the market.<!--more--></p>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="Logo_VA_group.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Logo_VA_group2.png" width="280" height="37" />
<p>To achieve this goal, a new project was launched to build an entirely new claims handling system called ECHO: European Claims Handling Optimization. Given the complexity and risk of such an ambitious project, it's only natural that Van Ameyde decided to move forward using Agile Methodologies.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:20px;">As far as technology goes, it was also clear that using standard software wouldn't cut it. Not only does Van Ameyde have very specific business requirements, it also needed a technology that would allow them to continuously modify and align the ECHO solution with the business. At this point they decided to move forward with the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YJ2Rw_N0UdA?rel=0" height="345" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<div></div>
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Once the ECHO application went live, the business immediately saw the optimization results in the company's claim processing business. In particular, the business witnessed a <b>30% reduction in the time required to resolve a claim</b>. Not only that, ECHO also quickly became a powerful sales and market expansion tool, allowing Van Ameyde to streamline its ability to <b>open new branches to less than one week</b>, a three to four-fold improvement over the old system.</p>
<div></div>
<p>On top of that, and even though the ECHO application supports 16 different countries with unique claim handling requirements, 12 different languages, and 6 different currencies, Van Ameyde now has <b>unprecedented flexibility to customize claims processing</b> for new customers, something that was not possible with the old system.</p>
<div></div>
<p>All this hard work and the amazing results achieved by Van Ameyde and the ECHO system were rewarded this week with the 2010 '<a href="http://www.bpmsoa-communityofpractice.org/contest/Van-Ameyde-winner.htm">Business Agility and Process Optimization Enabled by BPM and SOA</a>' case study award, proving that vision together with technology can go a long way!</p>
<div></div>
<p><b>Congrats to Van Ameyde and the OutSystems delivery team!</b></p>

		<title>From Lotus Notes and  Beyond - An Agile Migration Story</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I wanted to share a recent experience I had with one of our newest customers. We'll keep the name undisclosed for now, but these guys are a truly global company and a recognized leader in their industry.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When we first met the customer's team, they were faced with the challenge of migrating away from antiquated technologies and hand coding into a platform that would allow their team to respond to business needs very fast but also with high quality and scalability. The team had evaluated tens of alternatives to achieve this goal and eventually decided on the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> as a technology that would allow them to achieve their time to market goals without sacrificing quality or scalability. <!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>I had the pleasure to be involved with this process from the beginning and on my last visit I was asked to help them define their migration strategy from the older technologies like Lotus Notes into a modern, web-enabled platform like <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a>. Now for the challenge: the team has been very prolific over the years and had well over a thousand Notes applications that need to be migrated, discontinued, or rewritten from scratch. The big question behind this process was clear - what is the most efficient way to determine which applications go where?</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>What goes where?</b></div>
<div>With this many applications it was almost impossible to understand the entire portfolio usage - let alone determine each application's fate. Luckily, the team had been disciplined and kept track of useful information like application purpose, templates used, and change requests.  Using an Excel file with all this information, the team built an OutSystems application in 5 minutes using <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/08/the-departmental-web-app---from-niche-to-mission-critical-1.html">IntelliWarp</a>. The application was then used to determine a <b>conversion score</b> for each application, taking into consideration five important factors:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Type of application</b> - Applications that were primarily discussion based were deemed more adequate for other technologies, like Sharepoint. OutSystems applications are typically high-value, highly customized applications that you just can't get out of the box;</li>
	<li><b>User population</b> - Targeting  reasonably small groups of users seemed like a sound strategy to initiate a technology deployment;</li>
	<li><b>Usage patterns</b> - Because value comes from usage, the team decided that highly intense usage would be a good scoring facet for the applications;</li>
	<li><b>Development team</b> - To ensure knowledge transfer happened smoothly, the old applications that were originally developed by team members staffing the new OutSystems dev group were preferred;</li>
	<li><b>Rate of change</b> - The OutSystems Platform is all about change - the team wanted applications that are alive and evolving, with constant requests for new features or tweaks to existing ones.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Taking into account the above factors, our "secret sauce" conversion score algorithm yielded a migration score that determined the benefit of migrating an application to the OutSystems Platform.  Because this was all done automatically and in just a couple of hours, target applications were defined and discussed much earlier than they would have been by any other means.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next, the team took advantage of the '<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/true-change/">speed to change</a>' capability of the Agile Platform by extending the new portfolio management application to record the proposed migration strategy (destination platform) when it came time to replace each old application.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Curious to see what the new portfolio management tool looks like? The screenshot below shows the application (with data erased for privacy).</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="app_profiles.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/app_profiles2.png" width="508" height="333" /></span></div>
<div>By using the speed of the Agile Platform, combined with technical skill and a healthy dose of pragmatism, the team was able to create the new portfolio application that helped them optimize a fundamental process in their work and bring more value, faster! - This is the essence of agility.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What about you? Do you have any similar success stories to share with us?</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Here at OutSystems, we also had a recent case of a low cost app that provided great value.
The marketing team follows a bunch of blogs, and sometimes they post comments or contact the blog writers. This was mostly done by a single person, so all information about the blogs was placed in an Excel file.
But the team grew! To make sure we don't post twice or spam the authors, information about the blogs and activities needed to be available to everyone.
With the help of the Agile Platform and IntelliWarp, an app was built in about 5 minutes. A bit more tweaking and adding of extra functionality took about 2 hours. Moving it to production? 15 minutes! (13 minutes for the production environment team to give us the right permissions!)
This means that in less than 1/2 day we turned a one man process using Excel into a full fledge web application available in production. Not bad!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It's October, which means it's time for another <a href="http://www.idc.pt/events/eventos_2010-10-20.jsp">IDC Directions</a> in Portugal. Keeping last years' tradition, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> sponsored this event and sent a team of ambassadors to talk to some of the key players in the Portuguese IT industry.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="text-align: center; float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" alt="idc-floor.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/idc-floor2.png" width="244" height="148" />
<div>Although the current economic downturn was part of the agenda, the feeling around the event was extremely positive. The opening keynote by Cort Isernhagen did a great job of putting the minds of everyone on  the need to make IT not only more efficient, but also more effective!</div>
<div></div>
<div>This was very much in line with what our own Mike Jones had prepared for his keynote.  His presentation was focused on "<b>The IT Efficiency Imperative</b>", and highlighted the fact that tough economic times tend to present innovative companies with the opportunities to react to new market conditions and chase that 'illusive' new pot of gold.</div>
<div></div>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="napkin.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/napkin2.png" width="200" height="187" /></span>
<div>In <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/miwjones/the-it-efficiency-imperative">his presentation</a> he set out four key concepts that ITs need to take into consideration to be not only efficient, but also effective in <b>helping the business innovate</b>.  The presentation was based on Geoffrey Moore's core/context model, and to help people visualize the concept, we printed it out on some paper napkins!  These were a huge success with everyone that visited the OutSystems stand as they listened to our presentations, drank coffee and ate OutSystems donuts!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Aside from the napkins, there was a lot more activity on our stand. On day one, we handed two <b>Agility Awards</b> to DGAL for a couple of projects: <a href="http://www.portalautarquico.pt/portalautarquico/">Portal Autárquico</a>, and the SIIAL and SIGE projects. On the second day, it was <a href="http://www.hovione.com/">Hovione</a>'s turn to receive an Agility Award for their <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/Hovione/Global%20Performance%20System/">Global Performance System</a> project, implemented by <a href="http://www.noesis.pt/">Noesis</a>. We also had a demo of <a href="http://www.iberomail.com/">IberoMail</a>'s solution on our booth, performed by <a href="http://www.normatica.pt/">Normatica</a>. Thank you all for coming and<b> congratulations on the projects and awards!</b></div>
<div></div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Like all good things, Justin James' <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/outsystems-agile-platform-the-ide-of-my-dreams/" target="_blank">Developer Diary</a> series has finally come to an end - a happy one at that!  Justin successfully used the Agile Platform to bring his <a href="http://ratcatcher.titaniumcrowbar.com/" target="_blank">Rat Catcher</a> application from idea to fully-fledged application.  During the last few months he learned the platform, overcame the challenges of scarce resources, infrastructure, etc to deliver his application.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="RatCatcherLogo.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/RatCatcherLogo2.png" width="200" height="50" />
<div>In his <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/wrapping-up-my-outsystems-agile-platform-application-project/" target="_blank">final entry</a>, Justin explains how he used the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> to retrofit some aspects of his application, specifically moving his layout from tables to CSS.  He also gives us his thoughts around the new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/agile-platform-5.1-release/">Agile Platform 5.1</a> as well as the lessons he learned using our platform.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>At the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> R&amp;D department, we've been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">Scrum</a> for quite some time now. But lately, I've been hearing quite a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a>. I've even heard of a team that's considering moving from Scrum to Kanban to be more efficient! With such claims I was obviously curious to find out more about this methodology, and how it relates to Scrum.</div>
<!--more-->
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="postits.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/postits2.jpg" width="100" height="101" />
<div>While doing my investigations, I found two key differences between Scrum and Kanban: The <b>rules</b> and the <b>workflow</b>.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="font-size: 15px;"><b>The rules</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Both Scrum and Kanban provide rules on how you should perform your work. An immediate difference between these two methodologies is the number of rules they impose.</div>
<div>Scrum is quite prescriptive, and has a vast set of rules. Here are just a few:</div>
<div></div>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><b>1.</b> The Product backlog is created and managed by the Product owner</li>
	<li><b>2.</b> Teams must be cross functional</li>
	<li><b>3.</b> The team's work cannot be interrupted during sprints</li>
	<li><b>4.</b> The team's work is time boxed</li>
	<li><b>5.</b> There's a daily scrum meeting, where the team answers to 3 questions</li>
	<li><b>6.</b> Progress is measured using a burndown chart</li>
	<li><b>7.</b> Teams do a demo to stakeholders at the end of each sprint</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li><b>23.</b> (You can find a list of 23 mandatory plus 12 optional rules in <a href="http://www.agileadvice.com/archives/2007/05/scrum_rules.html">Agile Advice</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>Kanban is much more open than Scrum, and it has only a couple of rules:</div>
<div></div>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><b>1.</b> Visualize your workflow</li>
	<li><b>2.</b> Limit your Work in Progress</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>Now, being such an open methodology, it tends to be adapted depending on the environment. For instance, Toyota defined 6 rules for its process. In fact, you can add all rules of Scrum to Kanban, and still have a sound methodology - with 25 rules!</div>
<div></div>
<div style="font-size: 15px;"><b>The workflow</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>A direct consequence of this difference in rules is the way the work items are handled across time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Scrum, you select the work you'll be doing for the next sprint beforehand. You then lock the sprint, do all the work, and after a couple of weeks - the usual sprint duration - your queue is empty.</div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="scrum-board.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/scrum-board2.png" width="520" height="219" /></span></div>
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #555555; text-align: center;">Typical flow of a Scrum process</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Kanban, all that's limited is the size of the queues, called the Work In Progress limit. This means that you can change the items in the queues at any time, and that there's no "sprint end". The work just keeps flowing.</div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="kanban-board.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/kanban-board2.png" width="520" height="208" /></span></div>
<div style="font-size: 10px; color: #555555; text-align: center;">Kanban flow, with a WIP limit of 3 for the Todo, and 2 for the Ongoing</div>
<div></div>
<div style="font-size: 15px;"><b>Which to pick?</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>The answer to this question is, as always, it depends.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you're doing feature development, which relies heavily on stakeholders' feedback and developers need focus to do a good job, go with Scrum. The sprint lock and the end of sprint demos to stakeholders are invaluable in this scenario.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the other hand, if your work is more reactive, and you cannot lock your backlog for a couple of weeks, go for Kanban. It's a great methodology for Maintenance teams that need to adapt to customer input on a daily basis.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Better yet, learn lessons from both models, and adapt them to fit the unique needs of your organization. This is the best way to become extra efficient!</div>
<div></div>
<div>What methodologies do you use? What are your experiences with Kanban or Scrum?</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I'd find more differences, but <a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook" rel="nofollow">Henrik Kniberg</a> points (almost) all of them.
However one thing which seems to be very important to me, yet it is often omitted is <a href="http://blog.brodzinski.com/2010/04/kanban-story-presentation.html" rel="nofollow">how disciplined your team is</a>. Since Kanban is very open and very flexible it is also easily abused be undisciplined teams.
Since Kanban prescribes close to nothing it means that a lot depends on what team agrees to do. Now if someone doesn't really care the whole thing is blown off.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Finally someone that explains in plain English the base difference between SCRUM and Kanban.
I just realized I've been actually using Kanban (for non development projects) for a while!
BTW , the images work great to explain how the workflow can be put in practice.
Thanks Rodrigo

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Kanban is not an alternative to Scrum. Kanban is not a development process in itself, it's just a simple method for managing work flow, whereas Scrum is a much more specifically defined development process. That's why when you compared 23 Scrum rules and 2 Kanban rules, you came up with 25. They are orthogonal.
Many folks use a kanban board to manage their Scrum process or other agile/lean development practices. For example, see <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/" rel="nofollow">Scrum-ban</a>.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the great run-down of the Kanban approach. It's good to learn many different approaches to workflow management so the best one can be picked for the occasion.
You're statement at the bottom is most valuable. "Better yet, learn lessons from both models, and adapt them to fit the unique needs of your organization. This is the best way to become extra efficient!" It's so true.
Thanks again!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Rodrigo, you hit the nail right on the head!  Kanban is great for software maintenance / factory.  It streamlines the process and helps manage the workload and of course, expectations.  Personally, I do not look at these methodologies as opposing or conflicting.  As you started to mention, each has its strengths for the specific objectives you want to achieve.  Here is a big difference:
A project, by its very definition has a beginning and an end (schedule).  It has specific objectives (scope) to be met and has a budget (cost).  The nature of scrum allows us to manage these types of projects more closely and have better visibility and ultimately accountability.  These types of projects are those that require us to allocate budget to a defined amount of work.  With every iteration of a sprint, every feature in the sprint needs to be estimated and when completed compared to actuals so that we can assess and manage the remaining work based on the remaining budget.
For those types of endeavors were we allocate work to a defined budget (i.e., yearly budget for product maintenance or enhancements) Kanban would be the preferred approach.  In this scenario, Kanban allows you to streamline and improve the process so that you can squeeze out more features against the allotted budget.  Because it is the process that is the focus and budget is readily available, some practitioners no longer estimate.  In fact, some argue that eliminating the need to estimate is one way to improve the process.
Something to think about!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Is funny how persons are. When you get someone from software development, and after sometime working in his/her field, you notice two things, mainly:
*The need to "grow" his/her human skill, reflected in the management development;
*And the discover of something in management, that we knew for a long time, like it was something revolutionary.
Scrum comes from software development projects, Kanban exists for a long time in management... try to guess which of them will inevitably have better results.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As far as I know Kanban tries to limit dependencies between different functions in the organization, for instance not having 5 developers waiting for the only business analyst in house to validate requirements for 3 different projects.
It is also looking at a more comprehensive set of activities/lifecycle than Scrum does, including for example user acceptance testing.
Yes, WIP can be applied with Scrum but in theory if you have good user stories estimation and you know your team's velocity then you shouldn't need more than common sense to limit your work in progress to a reasonable amount, right?
In short, I think both Kanban and Scrum are great methodologies but they address quite different needs and types of development. I have difficulty to understand how they could be used together.
Any thoughts?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the note, very well described and the graphs are very explanatory.
I agree with the view that they are not two comparative approaches, I see they come in different stages of the organization maturity of agile. During the starting of agile approach Scrum may be the best to apply with its prescriptive rules, practices and guidance. When the organization establishes level of maturity in agile then Kanban would be the best for a mature team focusing on the most valuable tasks and activities.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think there is any rule that says a Scrum can not be terminated.  Also, I think there is room in Scrum to allow more stories into the sprint IF the entire team agrees.  The summary you have ignores the retrospective.  Since I am not familiar with Kanban, I'm wondering if it has such a tool for pausing and introspection/inspection.  And what about the concept of Done?  Does Kanban allow for "at this point in time, X Y Z will be ready to ship"??
But your conclusion is right on the mark.  Let's not get bound by the rules.  Use what works to produce efficient business value and happy workers

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Kanban always makes me think of the theory of constraints.  You can very easily, visually know your bottleneck by seeing which lane backs up.  The lane to the right will be empty.  This is very good for optimizing team throughput, identifying the drum resource.  My $0.02.

It's good to get a clear understanding of it in plain English and this is what you've given us. The workflow and expected delivery style is the key to deciding which is your best method.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</b>
<div></div>
<div>I know, I know... Today is Thanksgiving in America only, but I still wanted to share it with all our followers from around the world. After all, it's the perfect opportunity to say "thank you" to everyone that has supported OutSystems throughout the years.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="turkey.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/turkey2.png" width="133" height="160" />
<div>Coming up with everyone that helped OutSystems is nearly impossible, so this list is bound to be incomplete... So, if I missed anyone, fell free to add your own "thank you" note on the comments. And don't be shy about adding yourself!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Without further ado, here's my own <b>incomplete gratitude list:</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Thanks to all our <b>amazing</b> customers</li>
	<li>Thanks to all our <b>59</b> implementation partners</li>
	<li>Thanks to all <b>13,651</b> IT pros that installed the Agile Platform to build their next great web app</li>
	<li>Thanks to our developers community who generated <b>492</b> ideas for improving our product in the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/wisdomofthecrowds/">Wisdom of the Crowds</a></li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>What's every manager's dream, after finding buried pirate gold, starting a unicorn ranch and marrying a beautiful globetrotting supermodel?  Why, improving  web application development productivity, of course!</div>
<div><!--more--></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="clock10.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/clock102.jpg" width="250" height="185" />
<div>Unlike the gold, mythical creatures and supermodel, this goal can be achieved. You can do it in small steps and realize slight improvements in team productivity. But if you're aiming at order of magnitude improvements, some deeper changes need to be made (it's still not as hard as starting a unicorn ranch).</div>
<div></div>
<div>When starting this process, it's important to consider the fact that both building new web applications and maintaining existing apps must be optimized. After all, the lion's share of a web application's cost comes after the first move to production!</div>
<div></div>
<div>With this in mind, I have pulled together seven tips to help boost web application development:</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">1. Automate deployment</span></span></span></span></span></b></div>
<div>Moving a web app to production needs to be as simple and as fast as possible. To be truly Agile and keep up with the business, deploying to production must occur frequently, or delays will stack up across the development cycle. If it takes two days to place new versions in production, your productivity will suffer.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">2. Reduce complexity</span></b></div>
<div>The more complex an application grows, the harder it is to change and adapt. The solution? Split the system into smaller parts when it starts getting too big. To do this, however, requires a technology that helps make sense of complex systems, as well as helping the development team split the system into more manageable components.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">3. Aim for production, from day one</span></b></div>
<div>It's tempting to hack out a quick solution for an immediate business problem, and later clean the application up to make it production-ready. This may seem like Agile, but in reality, it's vital to not neglect things like monitoring, scalability, logging, user management and so on. The ideal solution is to build on top of a platform that let's you take these requirements for granted.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">4. Impact analysis</span></b></div>
<div>To change quickly, the team needs to be certain that the changes will not break what's already working. This problem can be greatly minimized through three stages: First, use impact analysis tools during the development process: if a change to the database breaks the business logic, it needs to be immediately obvious. Second, use regression testing. Finally, make sure that the impact of changes can be measured, especially when placed in the production server with production data.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">5. Invest on Knowledge Transfer</span></b></div>
<div>Employee turn-around, different teams for development and maintenance, or the need to reallocate teams to different projects are all good reasons to invest in knowledge transfer. But don't put the burden of knowledge transfer on the developers. The documentation will never meet requirements and walking through code is slow and difficult. Use Domain Specific Languages or visual languages and relegate this work to the tools.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">6. Flexible Control</span></b></div>
<div>The advantages of having a 10 second deploy process are lost in the face of a two day bureaucratic process to approve a move to production.  To have true flexibility, two things are needed: full accountability - to know who to ask for help if trouble occurs, and; most importantly, the ability to rollback a not-so-successful move to production.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">7. Collaboration with stakeholders</span></b></div>
<div>The sooner feedback pours in from stakeholders, the sooner web app development will start moving in the right direction. There's no point in developing quickly if it's going the wrong way. With this in mind, it's highly important that stakeholders can easily provide feedback on what they would like to see improved.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Looks like a lot of work...</span></b></div>
<div>Correct - these aren't quick and easy steps (but it's still easier than that unicorn ranch)! But in following these tips, development teams can dramatically improve productivity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a case study for this, consider the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>. It was designed and implemented with all these factors in mind, and a recent study, based on function points, proved that teams using the Agile Platform are <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">10.9x more productive</a> than using standard technologies.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What other tips would you add to this list? How would you make your team more productive by an order of magnitude?</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Agree, agree, agree!  We've taken the '7 Steps' even further, automating some of our programming. This streamlines application architecture. We're using SQL and a tool called IronSpeed. We also strongly believe in collaboration (#7).  Once the CRUD app is created, it's really easy to run a quick round of customizations in Visual Studio and ship a prototype to the user. Saves time and prevents extra work.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Actually, managing the relationship with your customers should be tip number one.
Not only because it's the most important (specially if we are using an Agile method) but also because most of the other problems are caused by bad customer relationship. For example, complexity can be reduced a lot if this relationship is well managed. The same goes for impact analysis.
And it's easier to solve the root of the problems (and eliminate those problems forever) than create permanent workarounds to deal with the same problems over and over again...

		<title>A letter to Santa from an Agile Platform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: Courier, Arial; font-size: 13px; padding: 10px 10px; background-image: url('http://www.outsystems.com/aboutagility/paper_texture.jpg');">
<div>Dear Santa,</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've been a good girl in the last few years, providing ITs all across the world the ability to have a productivity they could never imagine. I help all kinds of developers, from juniors to seniors, to implement large and robust web applications in a fraction of the time they would take if using traditional frameworks.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right alignright" alt="xmas-logo.PNG" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/xmas-logo.png" />
<div>But I miss something... I miss a fast way to reach those developers that have not heard of me before. I miss a good way to let them know how valuable I am. Every time I want to introduce myself to someone I always need to take my friends SQL Server, IIS and MSMQ with me, turning that first introduction into a very formal commitment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This Xmas I would like to be tried by those developers much more easily. I would really like you to bring me a cloud trial service. That way I would only send them Service Studio, my IDE, to show them all the awesome things I can provide. It would really be fun if they could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">play around in my cloud sandbox</span> for a while.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh, and meanwhile, I could give them an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging learning experience</span>, with game-like tutorials that go straight to the point, contextually helping them whenever they need to know more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I bet all of this would really bring my users closer to me. And that would make me an even better girl.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: right;">Thank you Santa. Hope you drop by this December.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">The Agile Platform</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top: 30px;">Guess what... The R&amp;D team pulled up their sleeves and made sure that Santa would come sooner this year!</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Version 5.1.1</b> was released as a technical preview on Dec 2, and you are all invited to <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download/">try it out</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The entire team made such a fantastic job in focusing on the most relevant user stories, in order to deliver a valuable release in a much shorter amount of time, that in the end we got ourselves a small party... And we even got a new mug!</div>
<div></div>

<div>The best way to have a great Christmas, is to help others have a better Christmas! And you don't need to spend extra money to help others... sometimes everything  you need is already available to you, it's just waiting for a bit of imagination!<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are 2 ideas to help others on Christmas:</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:15px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">1. Reallocate Budget</span></b></div>
<div></div>
<div>There's always some budget allocated for Christmas activities. For example, to print some holiday cards, to send some gifts to special partners, customers and so on. What if, instead of spending the money on a bottle of wine for your customer, you bought a gift for a kid that wasn't having a Christmas without your help? I'm sure that your customer would understand. Just handwrite him or her note explaining that Santa made a detour while getting this year's gift!  If you add up a bunch of bottles of wine you will find that you can make a lot of kids happy!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="xmas-gifts.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/xmas-gifts2.png" width="538" height="438" /></span></div>
<div  style="padding-top:15px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">2. Recycle Old Hardware</span></b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Remember that old laptop you no longer use and that's taking up space in the storage room? It might be exactly what a kid needs to learn about computers and the internet. Having a computer can give a child the edge he or she needs to have a much better future, and all you have to do is clean it up, install a free operating system and deliver it! Way better than recycling! And while you're at it, why not install 10 laptops?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="xmas-laptops.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/xmas-laptops2.png" width="545" height="438" /></span></div>
<div>So there you have it, two simple ideas to help others for Christmas that don't cost you extra (well, we did offer lunch to the guys that installed the laptops, but it was well worth it!)</div>
<div></div>
<div>What about you? What are your ideas for helping others, without making your CFO grind his teeth?</div>
</div>
<div></div>

		<title>What makes a great web app great?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Some web applications are just a pleasure to use. They work extremely well, they are gorgeous, they are fast, and they almost seem to guess what you want. <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, and <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a> are all good examples of such applications.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A lot of ink has been spilled on why these apps are so great: Focus on the user, tons of usability testing, heavy usages of statistics, contextual design, etc. are but a few of the reasons pointed out as drivers for success.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="greatwebapp.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/greatwebapp2.png" width="210" height="118" />
<div>But even though the end user interface is an extremely important part of what makes a web application great, I believe true greatness can only be achieved if the app is also first-class on the inside.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Greatness from the inside out</span></b></div>
<div>Ok, so I guess the next question is: What makes a web application first-class on the inside? Here are some characteristics I believe are key to build a truly great application:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Easy to change:</b> Great apps are evergreen. Even if in subtle ways, they're always improving and adapting to the latest requirements. To build a great app, you need to make sure your application can change as fast as your users' needs.</li>
	<li><b>Easy to understand:</b> From the inside! A great app will last for years. In order to keep it easy to change all that time, you need to consider that other developers will be working on the app. And they will need to fully understand it, if they are to keep it great!</li>
	<li><b>Robust:</b> The app needs to work. All the time. Non-stop. Everybody squirms when Gmail is down...</li>
	<li><b>Scalable:</b> Great apps attract a great number of users. To support all this activity, your application will need to scale. Good responsiveness is mandatory for a great app.</li>
	<li><b>Instrumented:</b> Sometimes your great app might end up responding slowly, or worse, not responding at all... if that happens, you need to be the first to know, which means that great apps are instrumented and monitored. That's the only way you can react and solve the problem, even before your users realize there was an issue!</li>
	<li><b>Secure:</b> We trust great apps to keep our data secure. You need to keep that trust. Trust is a marvelous thing!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>These are a few really important points to consider when building a great web app, but I'm sure there's plenty more secrets for a web application's inner excellence! What do you think? What makes your app shine from the inside?</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[True. In my opinion, those are the main points. Just to reinforce the the value of having instrumented web apps:
No one wants a web app with scalability problems or low responsiveness.
By having early access to real performance metrics (not metrics of simulated environments), developers easily detect stress points in applications, allowing for timely tuning actions, before reaching critical conditions for end-users.
Metrics also help developers assessing the impact of changing intensively used parts of existing applications.

		<title>7 things to consider when choosing a cloud-ready platform</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2011/01/7-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-cloud-ready-platform.html</link>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://vmtmpblog.domain.outsystems.com/blog/7_things_to_consider_when_choosing_a_cloud-ready_platform/</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Putting applications in the cloud offers the promise of reduced costs, flexibility, accessibility, not to mention the possibility to dramatically <a href="http://www.enterpriseefficiency.com/author.asp?section_id=1090&amp;doc_id=202692&amp;">improve the way your IT works</a>. But to reap all these benefits, you need to <b>make the correct decisions</b> when defining your cloud strategy - especially when it comes to your choice of development platform.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="cloud.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cloud2.png" width="250" height="172" />
<div>And if you deal with custom enterprise applications, more likely than not you'll have to <b>choose a cloudy-ready platform</b> to develop, build, test, and deploy them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are <b>7 things you should take into account</b> before picking your brand new cloud-ready platform:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Avoid lock-in - Code and Data:</b> Your code and data are part of your competitive advantage. You must own them. Make sure that, if the need arises, you can smoothly and safely transfer your code and data away from your cloud provider with minimal business interruption.</li>
	<li><b>Easy to move between on-premise and cloud:</b> What's departmental and on-premise today, may need to be global tomorrow. What's currently published on the cloud may become regulated and required to move on-premise the day after. Having the flexibility to easily move back and forth between the cloud and on-premise is a big plus.</li>
	<li><b>Easy to scale horizontally:</b> One of the big advantages of the cloud is that it allows you to grow your data-center as you need. The platform you use needs to be able to take advantage of this flexibility.</li>
	<li><b>Lifecycle support - ready for fast change:</b> It's not just about running applications in the cloud; your choice of platform needs to support the full lifecycle. You need to be able to develop, test, and change your application really fast.</li>
	<li><b>Easy, fast &amp; safe to deploy:</b> This is part of the lifecycle, but it's important enough to have it's own bullet! In order for you to be as fast as your business demands, you need to be able to deploy your app quickly and often. And you need to know that, should something go wrong, you can quickly revert back to a previous instance.</li>
	<li><b>Easy to integrate:</b> Integration will always be a big part of custom application development. You need to make sure the platform you pick integrates easily with your apps running on premise, with your cloud apps, or with off-the-shelf packages.</li>
	<li><b>Secure:</b> One of the biggest concerns around the cloud-computing is security. Pick a development platform that seamlessly handles this issue for you. This is important not only at time of deployment but also from the application execution perspective. If your platform handles this for you, you will save you a lot of time and headaches in the future.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>What would you add to this list? What are your main concerns, and what do you look for when thinking about your cloud strategy?</div>

		<title>Code liability - How to reduce your risk?</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2011/02/code-liability-how-to-reduce-your-risk.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It is now widely accepted that source <b>code is not an asset</b>, but rather a liability. This is a very strong idea that has a lot of impact across the IT industry and in the way developers view and perform their day-to-day work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of the <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/04/16/code-is-a-liability">earliest articles</a> on this subject was published on "Object Mentor". <!--more-->The article is really good, but while reading it I spotted something <b>I really can't agree with</b>:</div>
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><b>"</b></span></span></span></span><i>The problem doesn't go away if you artificially reduce the code. (...) Moving it into metadata and models and other forms doesn't make it any smaller, and often makes it worse. Hand-crafted code is almost always more readable, smaller, more optimal, more focused, more literary in its style than generated code or funky data tables.</i></div></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top: 20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #ab0404;">Models will help!</span></span></span></b></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="VISourceCode.PNG" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/VISourceCode.PNG" width="268" height="199" />
<div>I'm a strong believer in <b>Model Driven Development</b> (MDD). I think models are a great way to abstract low-level code, and can make software much easier to understand and change.  I'm not talking about using models as an intermediate stage to generate a portion of your code. True MDD means<b> the entire development process is done on top of the model</b>. Much like you use C# or Java instead of assembler language, in MDD you use models instead of C# or Java.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This may not completely fix the problem: following the article's reasoning, at some point the model will become the liability. But it will greatly reduce the risk of this liability for a very large part of your software. Why?  Models mean abstraction, which equals less objects to know and manage thus reducing complexity. <b>Models let you focus on the business problem</b> and not worry about all the plumbing to deliver a scalable, robust application.  Models reduce risk when change is needed and speed up the delivery process.</div>

<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;">Hand-crafted code is beautiful... for 5 minutes!</span></b></div>
<div>The best guy on the team (you!) builds this really amazing beautiful code. It's totally optimized, and it's so wonderfully written that angels weep as they read through the lines of code... <b>And then things change</b>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The code is handed out to the maintenance team, the requirements change, and assumptions used to build it turn out to be wrong... it really doesn't matter what the reason is, someone will have to touch your perfect code. And it's all downhill from there.</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;"><b>Blame complexity</b></span></div>
<div>It's not that other developers who will touch your code are idiots. It's just that the <b>context surrounding your code is huge</b>, documentation is typically inadequate, and although they think they get it, more often than not they miss something. The system is just too complex.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Once again, <b>MDD provides a huge help</b> in making the system look simpler. It makes it much easier to see the full picture, and it really improves knowledge sharing between developers. Of course there will always be problems so complex that even the model is hard to understand, but fixing the vast majority of situations is a big plus!</div>
<div></div>
<div  style="padding-top:20px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;">Some words of advice</span></b></div>
<div>As you probably noticed, I'm a big fan of MDD. But you do need to be careful when picking your tool of choice. A whole article could be written on that subject, but let me just leave you with three tips: Make sure your tool supports the <b>full development lifecycle</b>, prioritize <b>fast change</b> higher than fast build, and make sure the application generated by the model is based on <b>standard</b> technologies, is <b>fast</b> and <b>scalable</b>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My final advice: quit piling up the debt and start investing in MDD now.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Happy modeling!</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is no difference between what you call a model and program code.
If you can do one thing in your graphical tool with UML, I can do the same thing using a pure textual representation. And likely in java, python, ruby or lisp.
The thing is that for now :
- I can write the textual representation faster than you can draw the graphical version
- Code/Text has better support for refactoring
- Code/Text has better support for source control, versioning, branching, merging and support concurrent access.
- IDEs give you better assistance when writing code than UML editor when writing UML diagrams (think autocompletion, quick assist, compile errors...).
- As far as I know, debugging in an UML editor or debugging generated code is not that easy.
- Complexity of generating code from a graphical representation or a textual representation is the same. Ofen the graphical representation is serialized to some XML anyway.
- Virtually any text editor can be used to edit code. It may miss some nice features, but it is compatible. In practice UML tools can't work nicely together.
In fact some people thing globally. They will like models a lot.
Some people think about details. They will like code a lot.
Problem is... Software is all about details. Generalisation is good... But don't care of the real complexity of the domain and of real life. In computer science, you can't avoid dealing with the details.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@Nicolas mentioned that "some people thing globally. They will like models a lot.Some people think about details. They will like code a lot."
The question is: do we need to split these as two separate worlds?
Can't modeling and coding live together under the same IDE?
I think it's wrong to completely separate coding and modeling, and say that they can't work together and in tandem to increase the quality of apps and the productivity of developers.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[@michel
Things change through times, but CASE tools were the silver bullet in the 90s and they promised what MDD promises today and they failed miserably.
MDD is not even a hot topic now a days and I reckon it's because of its low applicability. There are contexts where it makes sense but probably not as much as people would wish.
There are various problems, the .Net Framework has evolved quite fast and sometimes breaking backwards compatibility.
Now, imagine that you had to handcraft some code because the tool didn't have the possibility to do something you needed or, as they show in the examples, you need to fill in some code to have the feature working. If for some reason the model is wrong and you need to regenerate the code from the model, you'll be in very big trouble.
Either you will have to merge changes and be in merge hell, or code the features again. Unless I'm missing something here, I can't see any other possibilities.
Maybe you can tell the model to learn from the code you wrote but if you had to write the code in the first place because the model didn't support the feature, how can this be done?
Also code generated by tools is usually cumbersome and difficult to read, it's usually not covered by tests and when it is, it only makes sense to generate them at the integration level and above, leaving you with the hard work of writing the unit tests when you have to add code.
What about performance, if you really need to get squeeze every bit of performance possible, how can you evolve the model and keep the performance improvements you've done? And this is assuming that the code generated is already highly performant, otherwise you might as well rewrite the whole thing.
But I agree with you that coding and modeling cannot be separated but because they are, in fact, the same activity. as Nicolas pointed out. They just live in different abstraction levels.
The OP does not agree with Object Mentor's blog post, but I think they're talking past each other. The OP has different problems in mind than the Object Mentor's poster had. What this post should have said is in which contexts MDD can be applied and which ones it cannot.
Let me throw a couple of examples, could this tool build github, heroku, facebook, amazon s3 or a social game?

		<title>3 Steps to Measure Your App Dev Productivity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, more than ever, <b>analytics are the keys to success</b>.  One of the areas that is still very hard to measure is the productivity of your application development teams.

While finding out how productive your teams are might seem scary, it is far <b>better than not knowing</b>. In this post I will provide three steps and some resources to help you start down the path to understanding the productivity of your application development teams. Once you have a means to measure and monitor, then you can iteratively <b>improve your application development productivity</b>.<!--more-->
<b>
</b><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;">1. Make the case for a metrics program</span></b>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="Measure Productivity" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/measure-productivity2.jpg" width="240" height="180" />Measuring just for the sake of measuring isn't very useful. The real benefit of having metrics is <b>gaining insight on what can be improved</b>. Not only that, metrics also help you set objectives, what I like to call ultimate goals, and then focusing your team on achieving this goal.

Some of the best advice I have found is from the analysts at <a href="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester</a>. This "Metrics for Application Development" article by Liz Barnett (UPDATE: Seems like the article is no longer available on the Forrester website. Here's an <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/better-metrics-for-application-developme/160901305">interview with the author</a> on the subject), discusses why metrics for application development are important and gives some good advice on what you need to measure and why automating the measurement process is a good idea.
<b>
<span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;">2. Measure your productivity</span></b>
From my own research and experience, <b>function points are one of the best mechanisms</b> to measure application size and team productivity. As stated by the International Function Point User Group (<a href="http://www.ifpug.org/">IFPUG</a>) using this metric for application development focuses measuring functionality delivered to the business, rather than how big the application is internally, how complex the code is, or what language was used to write the application.

Function points have been around for a long time and are a tried, proven and standardized approach.  There is a wealth of resources on how to measure function points, and I personally liked <a href="http://www.softwaremetrics.com/Function%20Point%20Training%20Booklet%20New.pdf">this PDF</a> from a <a href="http://www.softwaremetrics.com/">SoftwareMetrics</a> training course and <a href="http://www.devdaily.com/FunctionPoints/FunctionPoints.shtml">this 5 step process</a> for counting function points from <a href="http://www.devdaily.com/">devdaily</a>.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;"><b>3. Compare to a baseline</b></span>
After measuring your productivity, you need to <b>determine how your team performs</b> compared with other teams: poor, average or better than average.  There is good news - you can find benchmark information in numerous places. The one I like best is <a href="http://www.isbsg.org/">ISBSG</a>.  They provide function point metrics from across the IT industry and with their data you can compare your results and act accordingly.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ab0404;"><b>Go for it!</b></span>
So, what are you waiting for?  Get a small team to spend some time coming up to speed on counting function points for your organization or go find a third party resource to count for you.  <b>The investment will be worth it</b> when you can accurately assess your application team's productivity and make decisions based on this knowledge.

At <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a> we got our customers bootstrapped on this process by measuring their performance with something we called the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">OutByNumbers</a> project. You can take a look at the results from that study <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">here</a> and see how we automated function point counting. I have to say the results are pretty surprising!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Measuring stuff is always scary, in every area (development productivity, advertising ROI, sales forecasts...).
It requires high level thinking (Why am I measuring this, and what will I do with the results?) and a deep understanding of the inner workings of the process you're measuring so you can act upon the data you gather (Now that I got this number, what does it mean and what do I do with it?)
Your 3 step guide is a great guideline to getting this done. It looks extremely simple, and I wonder if there is more to it than what yo described. Is this the same process used in the OutByNumbers project?
The resources you linked to are great!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Michel,
At OutSystems we followed the IFPUG guidelines for counting function points.  We also used the ISBSG advice for measuring effort and their numbers to benchmark industry standards.  The link at the end of the blog post takes you to a set of links re the OutByNumers project.  It has links to a white paper on our automated approach to counting and an assessment of our approach done by a third party expert.
By looking at the findings across the 140 or so applications and different customer's IT shops I felt the findings provided a good assessment of how each team performed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This week I had the chance to interview Rui David, a long-time OutSystems partner and enthusiast. We talked about how he got interested in OutSystems, the impact OutSystems has made on his professional life and why he decided to create a new website aggregating listings of OutSystems jobs. I hope you find his journey with OutSystems as interesting as I did.<!--more--> </i>

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="Rui-David-s.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Rui-David-s2.jpg" width="150" height="176" />

<b>Hi Rui. Thanks for letting us have a moment of your time. </b>
My pleasure.
<b>
Why don't you start by letting our readers know a bit about you? </b>
My name is Rui David, and I've been working with OutSystems and the Agile Platform for quite a while now. When I was 2 years old my parents took me to Brazil, and I lived there for the first part of my life. Around 1998 I came back to Portugal, and started working at ROFF, an IT consulting firm specialized in SAP, and an OutSystems partner.

<b>How did you end up getting involved with OutSystems? </b>
In 2001 I watched a presentation of the Agile Platform done by Francisco Menezes and Paulo Rosado, and I fell in love with it. I ended up getting involved by helping to develop an extension to connect to SAP, and it was great. Bear in mind that at that time the OutSystems Agile Platform was in its infancy. If I recall correctly, we were using version 2.0, back then there was no such thing as 1-Click Publishing, or most of the other cool features we have today. But I could see that the Agile Platform was the way to go.

At that time my boss was very skeptical about this technology, and he didn't really support my involvement with the Agile Platform. However, one day there was a need for an OutSystems consultant for a long-term project, and I came up to my boss saying "Well, we have a challenge with OutSystems...". He immediately pushed back, saying that he didn't want to hear me talking about OutSystems, but the moment I said that there was an opportunity to place a consultant of ours in such a project, he went "now we're talking!", and was sold.

From then on, we started investing in OutSystems, and at the time grew quickly to having 12 people working in OutSystems across multiple projects.

<b>That's quite a story. What exactly enticed you about OutSystems at the time?</b>
Well, at the time I fell in love with the vision - and really, there were very few people paying attention to this. The company was still in the old offices, the Agile Platform as we know it nowadays still didn't exist... It was a small group of people who believed in this, with some external people who also believed, and I wanted to be part of it.

Now that I think of it, the amount of opportunities that OutSystems generated for all those involved, and the amount of companies that were created around OutSystems is huge. I mean, the number of projects I participated in, changing companies, going to customers abroad... OutSystems knowledge really became an asset, and a valuable one. Even if at the time people told me to stick with SAP and the traditional languages, looking back I know that the investment I did at the time has clearly paid off. It was really great.

<b>What's the thing you like the most about working with OutSystems? </b>
The thing I like the most has to be the grand finale, the "wow" that customers get when their project is all delivered. One thing I like about selling OutSystems is that you arrive at a customer with this huge problem, and I'd just drag things around and it was done... You wouldn't believe how many times I got "I can't believe this - it's too good to be true"! The look on the customers' faces is always priceless.

<b>We get a lot of that "too good to be true" comment! How did your career evolve from here? What came next? </b>
In 2005 I was presented with an opportunity to go to Madrid for a pre-sales position for OutSystems projects, on behalf of a company called Intionis. I stayed there for a while, and I even translated the OutSystems training contents to Spanish so people could learn it better, but eventually one of the partners left the company for personal reasons, and I decided to come back to Portugal. I often say that it was a great opportunity, and I learned a lot about people management, but it was also the most expensive Spanish course I ever had! (laughter)

Returning back to Portugal, I worked in several OutSystems partner companies as Delivery Manager, Engagement Manager at times, and other times as a one-man-show. It's all in a day's life for an IT consultant.

<b>What about now? What's next for you? </b>
Recently, an opportunity came up for me to go abroad again. This started back when I was in Spain. At the time, I went to Brazil to evangelize OutSystems, and did some workshops at a couple of universities. I gave them training in OutSystems, Agile, and after the training the best students would be invited to work in remote projects, from Brazil to Spanish customers. I ended up delivering some projects with the remote teams.

However, one of the university professors and one of students at the time worked at WPD, the leading Brazilian healthcare IT systems and consulting services provider. Three years later, WPD was searching for a new leading IT development platform, found the OutSystems web site and evaluated the Agile Platform. When they were in the process of becoming OutSystems customers, they approached me directly to go and work for them in Brazil so I am getting ready for a new adventure.

<b>Recently your new OutSystems Jobs website started getting some buzz around it. Could you tell us what's that all about? </b>
The idea for this project was born from the fact that I'm going abroad again. The last time I returned from an international assignment, one of the things I hated the most was not knowing what was going on in the OutSystems ecosystem. For example, who were the new partners, how had the market evolved, and so I had a hard time catching up. Even getting to came back now and then it was hard to keep up with everything. On the other hand, the most satisfying thing I found was that when I left there were 5 OutSystems partners, and when I returned back in 2005 there were 15!

This time around, I thought that the best way to keep up with all the action and also help others in a similar situation was to have things go through me, and centralizing all job offers regarding OutSystems in a single site!

That idea came up one day during work, and then I pulled it off during the weekend, and published a few job posts there immediately. From then on, I spread the site around, and the snowball effect started. The site's been up for 4 weeks now, and for an OutSystems-only job site, it's already getting a consistent 30-visits a day from all around the world, with Portugal being the majority of them and Netherlands in second with 11% of the visits.

<b>What are the plans for the future of the website? </b>
Well, while initially it started with me seeding the site with existing job postings for OutSystems, the idea is for it to grow organically. I already have 15 different entities posting jobs every day, and over 140 job postings there. Hopefully it'll keep growing, and will have even more people using it.

The idea in the long run is to evolve to a full OutSystems jobs site, where we also have different user profiles, so, whenever a job posting comes, the profiles are immediately matched to the posting so that the users who want to be notified of specific job postings will receive them. Companies will also get to know exactly who in the database fits the profile - as long as the users have given permission for it, of course.

Also, I'd like to consider how to link the website to the actual OutSystems site.

<b>Cool. I'm sure that the website is already a frequent stop of our community members. And from our part, is there anything you would like OutSystems to improve in the future? </b>
I'd love if OutSystems would make it easier for us to deploy applications in the most popular and standard hosting services, such as GoDaddy. That would be very interesting, and it's the main reason I sadly didn't choose to make the OutSystems Jobs website using the Agile Platform.

<b>That feedback is much appreciated. Before we wrap it up, do you have some final words for our readers and members of the community? </b>
Years back I made a bet on OutSystems, and what I see today is that the bet clearly paid off. It was the right one to make even when everyone was against me. But the truth is that working with OutSystems and the Agile Platform is easy, and I'll keep betting on it.

Many times people come to me with the question of whether they should pursue .Net or OutSystems. My reply to them - and a question to the readers - is whether they want to be programmers or consultants.

Do they want to earn money by typing lines of code, or actually making things happen? With OutSystems, you know what the end goal is, and you can just focus on that.

<b>Thanks a lot for your time. Good luck with your new venture!</b>

		<title>5 productivity boosting ingredients for your IT projects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A while back we conducted a productivity study with our customers, called <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">OutByNumbers</a>, to see how much more productive they were using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The numbers for this study showed that all of our customers were experiencing great productivity gains.  However,  as you might have guessed,<b> there were some projects that performed better than others</b>.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="gauge icon.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gauge%20icon1.png" />This didn't come as a surprise, but we decided to dig deeper and talk a bit with the people involved to see if we could identify what made one project go faster than another.  We asked them what were the major factors that increased their overall project productivity, and here are the top answers we got:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Small teams, highly experienced in the technology</b></li>
	<li><b>Teams that frequently interact with the business</b> and with extensive business knowledge</li>
	<li><b>A good, straightforward application architecture</b>, as opposed to complex or excessively layered architectures</li>
	<li><b>Frequent moves to production</b>, using a very iterative approach</li>
	<li><b>Applications with less demanding user interfaces</b>, like back-offices, usually lead to higher levels of productivity</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The first four factors are very much in synch with what Agile methodologies advocate, and its good to see Agile delivering on its promise.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But what really caught my attention was that last bullet. Crafting a top-notch, super usable interface is something that seems to take a lot of effort. Why is it so, and how can we improve this? Surely something to write about in a future blog post!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Do you agree with these 5 factors? Are there other major productivity boosters you'd like to share?</div>

		<title>SIIA PaaS Requirements</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2011/04/siia-paas-requirements.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The Cloud...  It's like teenage sex. Everyone is talking about it - but no one is really doing it. Also like teenage sex sooner or later you will. Thus while the hype is driving us all a bit crazy we have to pay some attention to how this will play out as sooner or later we will get involved. Like most things in the technology world, the concepts are not all that new.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What has changed is the terminology and more importantly <b>the availability of the technology has gotten better</b>. This makes things more accessible, usable, etc. For example, it was not but a few years ago that you still used a phone line and wire to connect to your email when traveling on business. How we forget the good ole days and thank someone for wireless access. In the cloud we are making access to virtualized servers, data stores and the needed services to manage them available under a utility model - <b>you only pay for what you use</b>.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="siia-clipboard.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/siia-clipboard2.png" width="220" height="310" />
<div>So the cloud. OK, I think we all get the basics of having a virtual data center and the notion of a utility model for getting access to a remote infrastructure. Being able to offload some of the operational costs associated with managing your infrastructure is promising. What I see as the real challenge is how all of this will impact the more difficult side of IT, <b>application development and management</b>. This is where we create business value and where the cloud has some maturing to do before its full promise will be recognized.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So what about application development in the cloud - how are you going to get it done? Well there is SaaS which is effectively the cloud's 'package' application market. This is good for those commodity processes where you can buy a package. But for the differentiating processes where you have to build an application we have to look at things like PaaS or platform as a service. To this end I wanted to share a snippet from a recent <a href="http://siia.net/aatc/2011/">SIIA article</a> that outlined their thinking on the minimum requirements you'll need to provide a "Best-in-Class" Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Multi-tenant architecture -</b> common technical resources and code instance for multiple client companies.</li>
	<li><b>Customizable/Programmable User Interface -</b> support the creation of high-flexible user interfaces without the need to write complex code.</li>
	<li><b>Unlimited Database Customizations -</b> provide ability to easily modify/extend the data model (i.e. construct objects, define relationships, specify validation rules/permissions) via a "point-and-click" declarative" environment.</li>
	<li><b>Robust Workflow capabilities -</b> engender process automation by providing "point-and-click" tools to easily define workflow processes and specify business rules.</li>
	<li><b>Granular permissions model -</b> multi-level control over security/sharing within/across applications and platform components.</li>
	<li><b>Flexible services-enabled integration model -</b> enable seamless integration of "cloud" application data and functionality via a flexible web services enabled integration model.</li>
	<li><b>Analytics layer -</b> enhanced ability to leverage aggregated data across companies and applications for analytics.</li>
	<li><b>Integrated content library -</b> common elements that extend the core application feature set, improve info-sharing and speed up go to market time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This list sounds reasonable. I would push back on the need for multi-tenancy.  Why?  If I am an enterprise IT shop wanting to build applications for my business - I don't share my application software thus this need is not important. I would also add the requirement to have my PaaS give me <b>the option to deploy any new application on premise as well as in the cloud</b> - you never know when something is going to force you to move your data and processes to a more secure setting. Check out the eBook the OutSystems team put together on PaaS <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/avoid-paas-development-traps/">here</a> and let me know what you are considering for application development in the cloud.</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Dominique,
If what you need is to create a web application with a single web page, your best choice is to go with our Community Edition. You can try it out for 3 days, like you mention, and then you can install it on your own machine or in a IaaS provider using the full version available here: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download/full/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/download/full/</a>
In terms of offer, we provide a platform to develop and change enterprise web apps really quick, by generating standard .Net or Java code that doesn't lock you in. <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/</a> . You can also take a look at what some of our customers achieved with our product in the case studies section: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/</a>
The licensing you saw is for the use of the platform installed on-premise or on an IaaS provider. If you're looking for a complete PaaS offering, stay tuned... in the meantime, take a look at what we believe is the right way to pick a good PaaS provider: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/cloud/" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/cloud/</a>
Hope you enjoy using the agileplatform!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>On May 19 and 20 we had another great edition of our user conference, the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep</a>. It was an <b>amazing event</b> with the <b>largest ever gathering</b> of our customers, our partners, members of the press, and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a> employees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During these two days we had keynotes, technical sessions, personal demos, breakfast tables, lunches and coffee breaks. And in all of these <b>everybody shared their work experiences</b>, their expertise using the Agile Platform, their ideas on how to make IT more efficient, and a myriad of other topics were discuss around making business and IT life easier.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>

<div>So that you have an idea of how busy the event was this year, here are a few of the numbers that made NextStep '11 so <b>awesome</b>!</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>We had <b>7</b> booths at the expo hall</li>
	<li>We filled <b>12</b> breakfast tables, each discussing an IT topic</li>
	<li>We handed out <b>12</b> agility awards to our customers and partners</li>
	<li>We had <b>27</b> great sessions on business and technology</li>
	<li>We welcomed over <b>500</b> participants...</li>
	<li>...from <b>10</b> different countries!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wmui9NLf7Zk" height="349" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<div></div>
<div>We had a lot of fun organizing this event, and hope everybody enjoyed it.

		<title>Custom SaaS Calls for RAD PaaS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I will bet that in some form or fashion you have Software as a Service (SaaS) in your organization. Now, I am not talking about packages that have been purchased and installed on your servers - I am talking about true SaaS. Where the software is running in the 'cloud' on your SaaS provider's servers. <b>There is a lot of hype around SaaS</b> and the hope that in the near future all your applications will simply be purchased in the cloud and start working immediately. Sounds great - right?</div>
<div><!--more--></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="paas-cloud.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/paas-cloud2.jpg" width="300" height="237" />
<div><b>Reality check!</b></div>
For most of us in Enterprise IT, the reality is that what makes our business different is the way we go about delivering our products and services to the market. This means that an off-the-shelf, <b>standardized SaaS application is not going to solve our needs</b>. Sure, SaaS is great for many of the commodity processes like payroll processing, accounting, etc. But what about the processes that make your business unique - is SaaS going to work here?
<div></div>
<div>Many organizations I have talked to are trying to force-fit SaaS to work for these unique processes. They are <b>struggling with wanting to customize their SaaS</b>, which is difficult. I see things like only using pieces of the SaaS app and trying to build new application functionality for the processes that are unique. Why are they doing this?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, for one, the promise of getting the application up and running really fast is a big attraction to the business. SaaS makes this possible due to the zero time and cost associated with setting up the infrastructure to run the application.<b> But all of these SaaS benefits are lost once you start customizing it.</b> When you try to adapt the SaaS offering to your unique needs, what started as a really fast time to market initiative, will quickly turn into a nightmare of tweaking and hacking an inadequate API and data model.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This might seem counter intuitive, but I think<b> the answer lines in Platform as a Service</b> (PaaS). Let me explain, we are starting to see new, extremely productive and easy to use PaaS offerings that give you rapid application development (RAD) with 'instant' setup to get your project started immediately. I like to call this<b> "RAD PaaS"</b>. Even more interesting... what happens when you couple free applications with the RAD PaaS environment? Now you can quickly deliver a custom fit application faster than you could configure the SaaS package. Thus,<b> the new wave of RAD PaaS offerings will provide a custom SaaS experience</b>, spelling the end of SaaS for anything but a truly standardized business processes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>OutSystems recently published a new eBook highlighting three customers who delivered unique applications in the cloud. Two of these examples are actually about <b>replacing existing SaaS applications</b> and taking advantage of this new generation of RAD PaaS offerings to accelerate deliverability and cut costs. Check it out <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/paas/3-examples-of-cloud-success-ebook/">here</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, how about your business? Is SaaS working for you? Have you tried RAD PaaS yet?</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building a <b>Mobile Web Application</b> is the fastest way to get a mobile app in the hands of your users. You get to build an app at a fraction of the cost of building native, it works on multiple devices from day one, and you don't need to go through the appstore publishing process (if you want to find out why Mobile Web Applications are the way to go, check this <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/mobile/kick-start-your-mobile-apps-ebook/">free eBook</a>).
<div><!--more--></div>
<div>But sometimes Mobile Web Applications just don't cut it... you either need to access a specific features of the mobile device - like the camera or address book - or you really want to get your app in the appstore. If that's the case, <b>Hybrid Applications</b> are a great solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In this video, we show you how to build such a Hybrid Application using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">OutSystems Platform</a> to build the Mobile Web Application, and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> to create a native shell on top of your Web Application.</div>

As usual the answer is: it depends ;)
If you stick to what was done here you won't have any offline functionality other than a nice warning that you don't have network connectivity. In many situations this is more than enough.
On the other hand, for the scenarios where you do need it, you should be able to either use <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/offline.html" rel="nofollow">HTML5's offline cache</a> to enable access to the data from the last time you used the app or, implement some of your apps' functionality locally by extending the local index.html for the scenarios where you don't have network connectivity.

		<title>Education and RAD PaaS - Like Peanut Butter and Jelly</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[IT professionals in the education space have a difficult task facing them - they have to meet the demands of students, teachers and administrative support staff with what typically amounts to a shoestring budget.<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="peanut_butter_and_jelly.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/peanut_butter_and_jelly2.png" width="224" height="224" />
<div>In the past few years, this has meant relying heavily on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions that, while inexpensive, tend to be difficult to integrate with existing school resources and rarely meet all the needs of a district. On the other hand, custom-developed applications can meet all of a school IT administrator's needs but are something of a pipe dream, thanks to the personnel, budget and equipment requirements.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is all changing, however, thanks to the cloud and, in particular, rapid application development (RAD) Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) - a category which is defined by the flexibility and power of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For an example, take Faith Academy. A private school with brick-and-mortar locations as well as a virtual curriculum, Faith's vice president of IT, Dan Stueck, was faced with having to upgrade several important applications with a very small budget. Rather than turning to SaaS, Dan <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/Faith%20Educational%20Ministries/Student%20Information%20System/">went with the Agile Platform</a>, leading to a highly effective partnership in the cloud. You can read the full article at <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2011/08/03/faith-gets-help-in-cloud-with-student-information.aspx">THE Journal</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our own Mike Jones also offered up his take on RAD PaaS in schools at <a href="http://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/interview-mike-jones-moving-schools-from-monolithic-to-customized-cloud-based/">EdTech Digest</a> - check out Mike's Q&amp;A for great insights into what schools can expect from the cloud in the future and why custom app dev is the future when it comes to school IT.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-bottom:30px;">What about you? What impact do you see RAD PaaS having on your school or your business?</div>

		<title>Bits &amp; Bijt Wrap-Up</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>After what we hope was a great Summer for all buddying agilists out there, we thought we bid the mad warm days farewell and welcome falling leaves and hot cocoa the best way possible: with one more <b>Bits &amp; Bijt</b>! For those not fortunate enough to have attended one already, Bits &amp; Bijt is the OutSystems developer meetup, held in the Netherlands roughly every 3 months.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now in its third edition, it is a very informal and relaxed event, where suit and ties give way to t-shirts and jeans and where ROI and economy planning play second fiddle to technical discussions and tales from the trenches over a can of soda and munchies.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course we always aim at having<b> incredible speakers</b> that set the tone for further discussions and this time was no exception.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Heading up we had the infectiously energetic Erwin Schmidt from <a href="http://www.b-synergy.com/">B-Synergy</a> talking about Agile SAP and how, after 2 years of intensive investigation, the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">Agile Platform</a> was the only solution that allowed him to create user-friendly applications over the SAP Enterprise Core quickly and sanely.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next up, was none other than our own Rodrigo Coutinho, main poster on this very blog, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> employee #1 and all around nice guy. Rodrigo did a great presentation on <b>Mobile Development</b> on 6.0 and, if you attended one of last week's <a href="http://go.outsystems.com/mobile-strategy-webinar">webinar</a> on the subject, you already know how knowledgeable he is on this matter. Great stuff all around, as is par for the course for all of Rodrigo's presentations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Closing the presentation track we had the <a href="https://www.oxxio.nl/">Oxxio</a>'s Matthias Preuter and Wim van den Brink, both staunch OutSystems advocates, who tag teamed to present us the challenges they faced when developing their first 6.0 project: a <b>Version Management solution</b>. This project makes heavy use of the Agile Platform's <b>Business Process Technology</b> and allows formal OutSystems application dependency "locking" and publication to other staging environments. It is still work in progress, but it beautifully showcases our user's ingenuity in extending the Agile Platform's workflow outside what's in the box.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We wrapped up the event with more informal group chats on the Platform and the meaning of life in general. We could tell you a bit more about both things, but we think it's better if you <b>join us next time around</b>! To all that attended, thanks for joining us and we hope you enjoyed yourselves. We @ OutSystems certainly did!</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was excited to read a <a href="http://www.sata.pt/en/press-releases/sata-featured-international-project-managementmagazine">story in<i> PM Network</i></a> profiling our client, <a href="http://www.sata.pt/">SATA International</a>, an airline headquartered in Portugal. The article highlights how SATA - using OutSystems' <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> - <b>built a custom airport operational management system</b> after the packaged software vendor behind their previous application came to them at renewal time presenting a significant price increase.<!--more-->
<div></div>
<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="GrupoSataLogo.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/GrupoSataLogo2.png" width="219" height="117" />
<div>"<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/em/buy-or-build/">Buy vs. build</a>" is a typical issue we hear from Agile Platform users, and as the <i>PM Network</i> article points out, the answer for SATA was "build" after they realized they could <b>reduce costs</b> and improve organizational efficiency by building their own application. For SATA, the airport operational management system is a critical application that needs to be fully integrated with SATA's operational systems. And after a short experience working with OutSystems' Agile Platform, <b>SATA was certain they had the right platform</b> to build their application .</div>
<div></div>
<div>As SATA CIO Paulo Ornelas said in the PM Network article:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><i>"Even having this limited experience, the success of our first agile deployment instilled confidence that both the methodology and the technology would effectively support the project delivery."</i></div></blockquote>
<div></div>
Once SATA kicked off this project using the Agile Platform, they were able to deliver the application <b>even quicker than expected</b>. Paulo Ornealas told <i>PM Network</i>:
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><i>"We actually issued the final release a month early, with an even higher than- promised level of functionality."</i></div></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And at the end of the project, SATA's decision to build its own custom application was validated, with <b>substantial financial savings</b> over what the packaged software vendor originally quoted them for their renewal:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><i>"Financially, we were able to realize significant savings in both capital expenditure and operating expense," </i>Mr. Ornelas says. The final solution came in at only 15 percent of the total cost proposed by the vendor, and it was totally tailored to the organization.</div></blockquote>
<div></div>

		<title>The 3 Mobile Architectures Distilled</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but I am getting asked more and more to deliver some type of application that has a mobile front end. Of course mobile is one of the big trends nowadays, and there are good reasons for it. In a recent Forrester survey, 75% of decision makers claim that <b>deploying mobile apps has increased their workforce productivity</b>.

The question I seem to get asked often is, how should you implement mobile? <!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="Mobile" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/iphone-blog2.png" width="148" height="311" />

To keep it simple, I have found that there are three implementation strategies you can choose from to build your mobile app:
<ol style="font-size: 1em;">
	<li>Native Applications</li>
	<li>Mobile Web Applications</li>
	<li>Hybrid</li>
</ol>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><b style="color: #ab0404;">Native Applications</b>
These are apps built for a particular device and operating system. They're cool because you can build extremely rich and interactive apps that take advantage of all of the phone's features. The problem is they're hard to build, and you need to have different code (and sometimes different dev teams) for each different device - a maintenance nightmare...</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><b style="color: #ab0404;">Mobile Web Applications</b>
These are applications that run on the device's browser. Using standards like HTML5 and CSS3, they provide a very good level of interactivity that is getting closer and closer to what you get from native. They run on a web server, instead of running on the device, which gives the possibility to deploy the same app for multiple devices and greatly simplifies application maintenance. The <a href="http://apps.ft.com/ftwebapp/">Financial Times</a> is an example of a major player that has decided to move from native to Mobile Web.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><b style="color: #ab0404;">Hybrid Applications</b>
These are a mix of Native and Mobile Web. A thin native shell is built around a browser, where the bulk of the application runs. The thin shell allows the application to access phone features that are not available in HTML5 (yet!). It also meets the requirements of being native in order to distribute the application on the appstore. On the maintenance front, well you guessed it a bit of a mix between the native and mobile web. Major players such as Facebook have chosen this route by building their own "wrapper" and then executing all the site content as a web app in that shell.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"><b style="color: #ab0404;">So, which to pick?</b></div>
<div>I believe the <b>best choice is Mobile Web Applications</b>. Of course the decision depends on the context, but most of the time Mobile Web is the way to go - particularly if you're considering Enterprise Mobile Applications. Here's why:
<ol>
	<li><b>Use what you know</b>: Reuse all the knowledge you have from web development. There are still new things to learn, but it beats learning a whole new system.</li>
	<li><b>No approval process</b>: Skip all the steps necessary to have your app on the appstore. Just publish to your servers and you're done.</li>
	<li><b>Auto-upgrade</b>: All your users will be using the latest version of your app. No need to manually upgrade the app on their devices.</li>
	<li><b>Ready for a lot of devices</b>: Using standard technologies like HTML5, your app will be ready to run in a lot of devices in one go.</li>
	<li><b>Be Agile!</b> By skipping the appstore approval process and by being able to release for multiple devices at once, you can have truly short iterations and release new features early to your users.</li>
</ol>
<div></div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This really depends on what type of application you are building and for who.
For example, If you are building an enterprise app, then it would be best to go with a mobile web app, for reasons that you have already mentioned in your article.
However If you are building a consumer mobile app, it would be best to go with a hybrid app, ... now you would ask why?
If you need to sell your mobile app to your customers, it would be essential to distribute/market your app via the appstore, without the appstore your business will fail, Especially if your business is new, your a start up, in this case your success will depend on the appstore.
Best Advice? Choose the right technology that is most suitable for your product, and your customer that will be using your mobile app.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The major malfunction I have with mobile web apps (or hybrid) is the increasing reliance on HTML5.  That's what everyone is touting.  The problems with html5 is no exception handling capabilities, hard to do offline support (not nearly as trivial as native apps) and the increased testing required.  Sure you might save dev time with doing html5, but you just shot up your testing time to test on all the different browsers.  And thats NOT even talking about the fact that html5 still isnt' standardized...ya, it's going to be standardized, but it's not yet and it's been perpetually going to be for over a year now.  The last hiccup I have with html5 is EVERYTHING is "oh just get another JS library."  Really?  html5 isn't really html5, its really JS.  Have you tried debugging that?  I prefer my native IDE thank you.

		<title>Add a bit of Xmas to your web app</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're already deep in the holiday season, but it's never too late to <b>add a bit of Xmas spirit to your Web Application</b>!

I thought about adding Xmas lights, flying reindeers, working elves... but it seems to me that for an Enterprise Web Application something a bit subtler was in order.

<!--more-->

So I ended up just putting in a bit of snow on the Sales application:
<p align="center"><object width="480" height="305" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6xnAa268O0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="305" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6xnAa268O0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Check the video to see snow in action, or visit the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/network/" target="_blank">OutSystems Network</a> to see it live in a real web page!</span></p>
If you're using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> and want to add some snow to your app, here's what you need to do:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkSolutions/ProjectDetail.aspx?ProjectId=273" target="_blank">Get the "Xmas" component</a> from the OutSystems Community</li>
	<li>Reference the component from your web app</li>
	<li>Drag the "LetItsnow" block to a particular page, or to the footer if you want snow on all pages</li>
	<li>Click 1CP, sit back, enjoy your eggnog, and let it snow!</li>
</ol>
If you're not using the Agile Platform, there's a bit more work involved...
<ol>
	<li>Get the Javascript file from <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/" target="_blank">this site</a></li>
	<li>Place the Javascript on all your front end servers</li>
	<li>Edit your pages and look for the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> section</li>
	<li>Add the line <tt>&lt;script src="snowstorm.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</tt></li>
	<li>Customize the snow with a bit more Javascript
<tt>&lt;script&gt;
snowStorm.snowColor = '#cccccc';
snowStorm.snowStick = false;
snowStorm.animationInterval = 75;
&lt;/script&gt;
</tt></li>
	<li>Make sure you didn't break anything!</li>
	<li>Follow the "move to production" checklist (if you have one)</li>
	<li>Send the changes to your ops team and wait for them to move it to production... hopefully that will happen before Xmas! :)</li>
</ol>
<div>Have a snowy Merry Xmas!</div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkSolutions/ChangeLog.aspx?ProjectId=273" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkSolutions/ChangeLog.aspx?ProjectId=273</a>
In case you're wondering, this downgrade was done manually: i.e. I rebuilt the Xmas eSpace from scratch in 5.1 myself. We at OutSystems really spare no effort to keep you guys happy, lol
Enjoy the component and the festivities,
Miguel

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><b>Mobile is one of the big trends for 2012</b>, and with the year just starting, it's a great time to make some predictions about what will happen in the upcoming months. So here they are, the 6 major mobile trends for 2012:<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li ><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Mobile Web will be the dominant architecture.</b></span> Native mobile apps may be sexy, but their cost and the lack of support for multiple devices make them a no-go for the  enterprise. According to Gartner, by 2014, less than 15% of enterprises will develop B2E native apps.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>HTML5 will keep evolving in 2012.</b></span> More access to the device's features and sensors are sure to appear in all the modern browsers, be it on the desktop, tablets or smartphones. This will close the gap between native and browser based applications, making an even stronger case for mobile web.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>CxOs will want dashboards on their tablets.</b></span> Having the data you need, together with strong business intelligence at your fingertips, is a dream value proposition for CxOs. Having the access in their hands at all times is golden. Reports and dashboards on the tablet will soon become the norm in every meeting.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>The Enterprise AppStore.</b></span> Since mobile web applications aren't available on the appstore, enterprises will need to build their own appstores. These are simple applications where users can access specific mobile web applications depending on their role and permissions.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Geolocation everywhere.</b></span> One of the game changers of mobile is that that we now carry a lot of sensors with us. And location is a very interesting bit of information that is currently underused. There are already examples of reminders based on location and the like, but I'm betting on 2012 to give us some really creative uses of geolocation.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Mobile will push the cloud.</b></span> About 1/3 of the companies that adopted the cloud, did it in order to be able to access information from any device. Compounded with all other cloud advantages, I believe mobile will be on the forefront of cloud adoption during 2012.</li>
</ol>
<div style="padding-bottom:20px;">So here they are, the <b>6 Major Mobile Trends for 2012</b>. Here's a video presentation that gives a bit more insight on this topic and, if your want to learn more about how to build mobile applications, be sure to visit our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/mobile/">mobile page</a>.</div>

		<title>The Big Move: How We Migrated Core Applications to the Cloud</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>For the last couple of months, it seemed a few of our core applications weren't behaving as well as they should... Some applications were running a bit slow, and we experienced connectivity problems related to our ISP.</div>
<div>This was serious because these are core systems running on top of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>, and include our website, our community, our partner network, our product management tool, and a host of other internal applications.<!--more-->Since responsiveness and availability are two fundamental traits of a great app, we had to do something about it. We decided to move our infrastructure to the cloud, in particular to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>. And because these were core apps, we had to do it with minimum downtime and guaranteeing all the needed accesses.</div>
<div style="padding-top: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b style="color: #1f5ba4;">The old infrastructure</b></span>
The infrastructure we wanted to move to Amazon was made up of two separate OutSystems production environments - we decided not to move the development and QA environments. These environments and their applications were built using a Service Oriented Architecture to communicate with each other, and to integrate with third-party apps like <a href="http://www.pardot.com/">Pardot</a> and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>. Another part of the challenge was that these systems are used by internal OutSystems' applications, deployed in different infrastructures - including business-critical integrations with the R&amp;D process. This raised some security concerns and some challenges on how to keep supporting these integrations with minimal changes to the architecture.</div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="cloud-application-migration.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cloud-application-migration2.png" width="526" height="350" /></span></div>
<div style="padding-top: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b style="color: #1f5ba4;">The new setup</b></span>
Since the machines about to be replaced were near retirement, and because in Amazon we can add machines as needed, we decreased the number of servers from 5 front-ends to 3. We have an additional machine with SQL Server and, at the time of writing, all machines are m1.large (2CPU, 5 Amazon ECU, 7.5GB RAM). To distribute load between the Amazon front-ends, we are using Amazon Load Balancer.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b style="color: #1f5ba4;">Preparing for the big move</b></span>
In order to perform the move, we used an approach similar to the hot-standby approach suggested to our Agile Platform customers. The idea is to setup an infrastructure on the cloud, and use the disaster recovery option to move control to this new infrastructure. For this, we had to:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure all users were accessing the in-house systems from the outside network, just to make sure that everything that was needed was in fact available. This was good to identify certain content that needed to be accessed via HTTPS, for security reasons;</li>
	<li>We had to set up a database mirror for the SQL Server database. This was a big step, considering we moved 120Gb to Amazon -- a 2 day transfer! And since our internal infrastructure kept working, by the time it was done we had an extra gigabyte to move. Also, being two remote installations of SQL Server, we had to setup a secure mirror with certificate authentication -- which has its own tricks as well;</li>
	<li>We then installed the front-end servers in the cloud, and set them up to connected to the in-house database. This was easy, since OutSystems already provides Amazon images. The trickier bit was to ensure a secure connection with our internal systems, something we achieved using OpenVPN;</li>
	<li>Finally, we tested to make sure everything was working. We used some automated test scripts, and took the chance to identify dependencies with internal systems. To fix these dependency issues, we had to move some components back to the internal datacenter, and connect everything using webservices on top of HTTPS. Fortunately, this is really easy to do with the Agile Platform as it makes building webservices and delivering a service oriented architecture easy and fast! The only thing we couldn't test was performance... after all, the database was still in our datacenter, 3 thousand miles from the front-ends.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div style="padding-top: 1.25em;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b style="color: #1f5ba4;">Pull the switch!</b></span>
With all the preparation done, it was time to go full cloud. Here's what we did:
<ol>
	<li>We started by turning off the in-house systems. No problem here, just had to put an unavailable page and stop the OutSystems' Agile Platform and IIS.</li>
	<li>Next, we brought the cloud database server up. We were a bit worried with the time it would take to resync our SQL Server mirror after the rotation, but it only took about a minute. It took less than 5 minutes to have everything ready and to configure.</li>
	<li>After that, we reconfigured the Agile Platform to use the cloud database. No problems there, we just had to launch the configuration tool, modify the database settings, and restart the platform.</li>
	<li>Finally, we had to change the DNS servers to point to the new infrastructure location.</li>
</ol></div>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b style="color: #1f5ba4;">The results</b></span>
In the end, we definitely achieved our goal: Our core applications are running faster, and in time we'll be able to measure how connectivity improved since moving to the cloud.

It's also amazing how fast we were able to make the move. The procedure took 4 hours, but it could've easily taken 30 minutes if it wasn't for DNS. DNS ended up being the big bottleneck on the whole process, due to the time it takes to propagate. This is something we'll need to do differently, if we repeat this operation in the future.

In the end, the work was made a lot simpler thanks to the Agile Platform. Not only because it's totally prepared for these redundancy server scenarios, but also because it's so easy to change configurations and have everything running with the new settings in no-time.

Maybe even more important, the Agile Platform made it fast to split the components we wanted to keep in-house, and glue everything together with an SOA architecture. Being able to be <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">extremely fast</a> really opens a world of possibilities!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven't yet heard about <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep</a>, I want to share a bit more info about what we have planned for 2012! This year the event will take place on May 10 and 11 and we're expecting over 400 participants in Lisbon during next week, ready to learn, network and have some fun. To host the event we picked a new, beautiful and cool location - the Lisbon Congress Center in Parque das Nações, right on the waterfront.</p>
<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="OutSystems_ConviteNextStep2012" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/OutSystems_ConviteNextStep2012-12.jpg" width="320" height="167" />
<p>Our main theme for NextStep 2012 is "<b>Simplicity</b>"! This will be our motto throughout the 2 days of the event. Come and learn about streamlining complex IT processes while delivering highly usable 'great' applications. Many times simplicity is undervalued, underestimated, or simply ignored and the result is a loss of efficiency, increased costs, and damaged reputation. Achieving simplicity is a lofty challenge that expands beyond IT to the entire business.</p>
<p>Our keynote speaker, <b>Dave Thomas</b>, will also explore the world of Information Technology with a look to the future and highlight the pitfalls of complexity along the journey. Dave is an industry icon, and I'm sure you'll love his presentation.</p>
<p>To finish the first day, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/management-team/">Paulo Rosado</a> will go on stage with <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/management-team/">Mike Jones</a>, and together they'll launch the much anticipated and awesome new version of <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>' flagship product, the <b>Agile Platform 7.0</b>!</p>

<p>

For day two, we have 3 power tracks filled with great presentations. Two of the tracks are devoted to our growing technical community, and are dedicated to the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.
<ol>
	<li><b>Power to the 'ility'</b>, a track dedicated to maintainability, scalability and all things to do with a sound design and architecture.</li>
	<li><b>Power to the Platform</b>, a track focused on getting the most out of the Agile Platform, from cutting edge tips to sessions on simplifying devops.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The third track,<b> Power to the Business</b> is dedicated to the close relationship between IT and the business. This is a don't miss track if you want to learn how to deal with the latest IT trends, understand the 10 agile practices that are key for success, and attend inspirational sessions on mobile and usability!</p>
<p>This year we'll close the event with a new and fun session entitled... you guessed! - <b>Power to Simplicity!</b> In this session we'll make sure you don't miss anything from each of the tracks, we'll recognize key community members, and we'll also reward a lucky participant with a special prize. Be sure not to miss it!</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/agenda/">full agenda</a> and <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/register/">register online</a> at the NextStep website. Be sure to <b>register quickly</b>, we're almost out of seats!I'll see you there!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">NextStep 2012 is a wrap! Everyone agreed that this year's event was truly a NEW NextStep. If you were able to join us, you know you were part of something special. For those who could not make it, here are the 2 keys that made this a <b>NEW</b> NextStep:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="NextStep 2012" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/venue-blog2.png" width="227" height="302" /></span><b><b></b>New Venue</b> - This year the event was located in Lisbon's Expo area, a cool, modern part of town. Everyone loved the change and it really appealed to our Internationals guests who enjoyed the proximity to the airport, great restaurants and attractions all within walking distance. The new NextStep had the largest number of international visitors ever and that really gave the event a global feel.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><b>Educational Focus</b> - This year we really focused on providing high value content, no matter what your role. To accomplish our goal we called on our experts across different areas including the OutSystems R&amp;D team, Solution Delivery experts, and partner specialists. For the first time we had 3 different educational tracks. Power to the Business, Power to the Platform, and Power to the 'Ility'. For most, the hardest choice was which session to attend... but don't worry if you missed any session, we got you covered! Find all conference materials here or ask us a question and we will be glad to help.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<p style="padding-bottom:20px;">The NEW NextStep was truly a great gathering of the OutSystems community, with all the participants saying that they would recommend the event to a friend. Check the video below to witness some of the highlights of NextStep, or go to the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep website</a> to get the presentations, photos, and more.</p>

		<title>Agile By the Numbers - Which Ones Don&#039;t Make Sense?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<div align="left">As an agile practitioner I have had the chance to participate in many different projects over the last five years. I have had a chance to see projects of beauty and those that simply did not go as desired. Recently, I was asked to support a project where the customers' IT team was embracing agile and trying to follow a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">SCRUM</a> based approach 'by the numbers'. It was this project that shone some light on the way we practice Agile here at <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a> and has helped me really reflect on our enterprise approach and things we practice that just make sense.</div>
<!--more-->

</div>
<img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="paint-by-numbers.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/paint-by-numbers12.png" width="286" height="377" />
<div align="left">Now, don't misunderstand. The customer had good reason for the 'by the numbers' approach, but I found many steps/processes impractical, slow, and in some instances frustrating. Here are the 'by the numbers' items that I found painful and why.</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left"><b>Project Analysis</b>: The team did no up front analysis, and only did analysis as they entered each sprint. By not doing some high level analysis for the entire project at the beginning, we could not anticipate the best architecture. This lead to a lot more refactoring than I'm used to on a project. It also hinders the ability to do any early usability analysis, something we at OutSystems have found to be vital for delivering a great app!</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left"><b>Story Pointing</b>: The 'by the numbers' approach made us do story pointing (assigning points to stories as an abstract measure of its complexity) and sprint planning (estimate each story and its tasks to see what fits in the sprint). Turns out that, in my opinion, story point analysis is amazingly painful, inefficient, and not very accurate - especially if you are setting up a new team, working on a relatively small project, or have little prior experience on the type of project you're embarking. Not only that, it becomes redundant compared with sprint planning, which definitely cannot be skipped. The sizing approach we have devised is much more accurate and efficient, plus it directly supports our sprint planning efforts saving us time. However, it does require some high level analysis around user stories and data.</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left"><b>Team Interaction</b>: While I am a firm believer in scrums - we use them daily - there is a point where you don't need the whole team to participate in each and every decision that is taken on the project. By having everyone on the team participate in every decision, we ended up slowing down the delivery and having folks involved in stuff they had no interest in at all. Some pragmatism in who gets involved in each decision makes a lot of sense. The OutSystems approach really streamlines our decision-making process, by splitting the <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/scrummaster">SCRUM Master</a> responsibilities into two roles: the Engagement Manager and Delivery Manager. This truly helps the project go at light-speed without sacrificing quality.</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left"><b>Sprint Demos</b>: Since analysis was done during the sprint, we end up with great business participation. However, at the end of the sprint the final results are anti-climatic as the business team members have been involved every step of the way. The down side is that the business users were way more involved than necessary, something that does not happen in the OutSystems approach. Don't get me wrong; business user feedback is obviously critical, but just not needed on every hour of every day. Our approach focuses on delivering 'high impact' sprint demos where the end customer is amazed at what we deliver. This is where we collect feedback that leads to a more engaged business team and a better overall application.</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left">There are lots of ways to practice agile, but a healthy dose of pragmatism, formalism, and common sense will go a long way to help your team move fast and deliver great applications!</div>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[About the story-points.
What's exactly the difference between story-points and sizing.
where sizing on the agile-method needs a even bigger understanding about user-stories and what impact it has.
while with SP's you can give a rough estimate upfront, except for those you are throwing into the sprint.
I find the biggest issue with your sizing you have to know everything upfront and size it accordingly (in contrast of what the agile-manifesto means)
SCRUM and storypoints give you better agility and only focuses on the 1-2 sprints.
the highlevel blueprint of the application you need in both cases, so that is a bit of a false point :)

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The story points are really helpful when you have a team experienced in the project they're working on, the team is fixed or doesn't change a lot, and you can bare a 50% error (some SPs will be overestimated compensating the under estimated ones).
For the initial estimation, it kind of works ok if you have some previous experience. Over here at OutSystems, we've measured a large set of past projects to identify patterns, which allow us to have a better estimation in terms of days. That is usually what you need to give a customer (the # of days the project will take) as he needs real predictability.
On the other hand, in the delivery process of a long-running product, story points are working perfectly for us. We know and constantly measure our velocity, and the story points multiplied by our velocity give us an impressive degree of predictability (higher than I would ever imagine).
The issue with customer projects is that usually they're not an ongoing effort. You have a fast start, a new team popping in, a new set of business stakeholders dragged into that don't fully grasp the process (and the challenges of tradeoffs) so you need to adapt.
On the sprint planning, story points are just too broad imo. At that point, you have quite good information of what you need to do to accomplish that sprint goals. The initial estimate gives you the slack to work with changes, but before the sprint starts I like to really detail and plan that sprint, already considering the feedback from the previous demo. It becomes easir to have the buy in from the development team, because they study in detail what they need to do.
So... I agree that pure SCRUM and storypoints give you more agility... but how far can you go (or how relaxed can you be) with SCRUM for a 3 or 4 months project, on a team for which you don't know the velocity yet?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not sure I agree with your view on story pointing . As the driver from within the business I believe it is our role to define the story boards, attain the wider business concurrence and then engage the Business Analysts on our seconded IT team. We operate with this model on a very successful program that has been in almost continuous development for five years. However, it was only when we reverted to AGILE that we started to deliver change in accordance with the business need
A lot of the comments I read on AGILE does tend to be IT related and the most important element being missed, the close working relationship of the customer and the delivery team. It's this that allows the wider strategic picture to be understood when planning the short, medium and long term sprint goals.]]></wp:comment_content>

<div align="left">As I talk to different IT managers and their teams about how they go about application development when building custom software I am always amazed by the excuses as to why their team cannot change. They range from compliance and regulatory issues, lack of time to learn a new technology and everything in between.</div>
<!--more--><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="radical-change.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/radical-change12.jpg" width="220" height="193" />
<div align="left">The frustrating part is that in practice the three things I keep harping on actually work very well and can lead to radical productivity improvements. <b> What is holding back CIOs and their teams from really investing in making changes that can dramatically improve the way they perform?</b> Share your opinion in the comments below.</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left">If you want to know the <b>three productivity enhancers</b> I always recommend to enterprise IT shops check out the<b> IT Productivity Webinar Series</b> just wrapped up by the team at OutSystems (along with some industry insiders) below. I doubt you will be surprised by the topics:
<ol>
	<li style="padding-bottom:15px;"><span style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Tools</b></span>: Leverage a development platform that lets you build, change and deliver with amazing speed and quality. This webinar was given by John Rymer, industry analyst at Forrester, based on research report published at the end of 2011 titled '<i>The New Productivity Platforms: Your Solution to the AD&amp;D Crunch</i>'.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom:15px;"><span style="font-size: 1em;padding-bottom:15px;"><b>Methods</b></span>: No matter how good your tools are, if you build the wrong system you are doomed to failure. Thus, I advise embracing an Agile approach and start delivering in small iterations. This webinar shared 9 rules for doing agile in the enterprise. Dave Thomas, agile evangelists and founding director of the Agile Alliance provided insight and comments on our rules to keep us honest.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Process</b></span>: Once you start to embrace Agile and have the tools that let you deliver fast and often you will have to overcome a final hurdle - streamlining the handoffs between your development and operations teams. In this final webinar we shared <b>5 tips to overcoming releasephobia and streamlining your DevOps processes</b>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
&nbsp;
<div align="left">Click <b><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/it-productivity-webinars/">here</a></b> to access all <b>three recorded webinars</b> and supporting materials. Good luck with improving your productivity and be sure to share your favorite excuse for not making a change.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Considering a <a title="New York Times" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/hard-times-could-create-a-tech-boom/" target="_blank">New York Times Bits Blog article</a> stating that enterprise-wide, IT spending will be $2.68 trillion in 2013, one would think the IT industry - with all its engineering nerd-brain powers - would be at the forefront of efficiency and automation. Curiously, this is not the case. Not even by a long shot. Not even remotely. Not even ... well, you get the picture!<!--more-->

And if what <a title="Gartner" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/497088" target="_blank">Gartner</a> writes is true, then 80% to 85% of an IT department's budget is used simply to <a title="KTLO" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/madgreek/the-keeping-the-lights-on-mentality-27871" target="_blank">Keep The Lights On</a> (KTLO).
<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soccer_blooper1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1240"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1240 alignright" alt="soccer_blooper" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soccer_blooper1-300x241.jpg" width="300" height="241" /></a>Let's allow these numbers to sink in appropriately, shall we: <a title="Total Spending" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2292815" target="_blank">At least $2.68 TRILLION IN TOTAL SPENDING</a> and 80% to 85% of IT BUDGETS USED ON WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY MAINTENANCE? That sounds like a winner to me! How many more zeroes can KTLO have?

All this money going to maintenance actually creates a second rail of inefficiency - a pileup of new requests made by the business that IT cannot deliver. This is the IT department's backlog and is no small matter. It indicates lost productivity, an inability to innovate and the reflection of an IT department misaligned with its core business.
It is not merely a fact of functionality requests being stuck in a rut and arriving late that is the problem here. Here's another industry stat attributed to Gartner: the backlog in most IT departments is actually compounding annually at a rate of 10% to 20% - meaning in the worst cases, a company's backlog could double in five years!

<strong>So, to recap: trillions of dollars in spending, most of it going to maintenance, and an ever-increasing backlog.</strong>
<h3 style="padding-top: 15px;"><strong>Could it get worse?</strong></h3>
Here's the hat-trick! Any attempts to bring this backlog under control will bring with it a cost, the value of which is added to the KTLO. If an organization attempts to tackle its backlog by building apps in a fast and furious manner, it makes compromises that impact future IT debt. The conundrum is simple:<strong> IT departments can implement change requests quickly and create greater IT debt, or they can take their time, not empty their backlog fast enough and be accused of being unresponsive to the core business</strong>. Any attempt to fix the inefficiency problem potentially adds to it. Technical debt grows. Backlogs get bigger. IT is eventually left behind, unable to react to the needs of business.

<strong>Spend money. Lose ground. Disappoint management. Fail. Fail. And Fail.</strong>

Given the exorbitant amount of ducats in play, why would any organization close their eyes to so much wasted productivity and spending? Why would any organization continue along the same path expecting something different?

The way companies are currently dealing with their backlogs and technical debt is not working. It is an unsustainable business model that will render IT departments ineffectual and in danger of collapsing under their own weight.

This failure is not entirely IT's fault. In fact IT departments are probably doing the best they can. The problem is simply that maintaining enterprise systems is extremely hard and therefore expensive.

The bigger and older the system is that needs to change, the more complex and costly that change will be. We all know how hard it is to reverse engineer thousands of lines of code to find the exact places where we need to apply the changes. And how hard it is to validate the impact of those changes across all application and system dependencies. And even when changes are ready and tested, how hard it is to deploy a new version into production.

<strong>Unless we solve the problem of the cost of change, we will not be able to reverse this downward spiral that is causing IT to fail miserably.</strong>

I'd make a <a title="OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform" target="_blank">suggestion</a>, but this isn't a sales pitch. It's only the IT equivalent of a Public Service Announcement. An eye opening piece, really.

Happy Spending in 2013!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Modernizing Legacy for Mobile Use: Look Before You Leap</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/03/modernizing-legacy-for-mobile.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Mobile applications have become a recurring topic everywhere we turn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our customers' IT departments are being pushed by their business units to create all sorts of mobile interfaces. If you look at the application backlogs at most IT departments, you'll find more than a couple requests for something mobile.</p>
<!--more-->
<p class="MsoNormal">Most of those requests include extending existing legacy systems to provide mobile interfaces that can be used by customers, partners or employees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you're about to leap into the mobile world and need to provide unique capabilities that are extensions to existing systems, you probably have big plans to customize or upgrade those systems to enable mobile access.  If this is the case - <b>Read on before you Leap!</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or consider this an intervention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1em;">So your business says they want mobile; they have to have mobile!  We understand.  The growth in mobile app usage and the prevalence of mobile phones and tablets in the workplace (and all the </span><a style="font-size: 1em;" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2029540/when-alien-hardware-invades-4-keys-to-byod-success.html">BYOD</a><span style="font-size: 1em;"> frenzy that everyone is writing about) makes having mobile a necessity and also an opportunity to increase worker productivity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"><b>Think about maintenance before you start:</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please consider this before beginning a mobile adventure-- <b><i>the cost of customizing your legacy systems to implement mobile will grow exponentially year after year.  It will eventually create a maintenance nightmare and may even hinder future product upgrades</i></b>. The older and more monolithic the legacy system, the larger the maintenance problems will be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The cause for this is simple: mobile applications require a level of flexibility and a pace of change that is completely different from the pace of change of your legacy system. For a mobile application to work and be adopted, you'll need to focus most of your energy on delivering a great user experience (UX). No matter how many usability tests you do, one thing is certain: when the app is rolled out to your users, you'll discover a lot more changes that need to happen in order to provide a better UX. What this means is that you'll need to have the ability to quickly adapt your application (to change it's interface or even business logic) and redeploy a new version of it, so it can be in the hands of users for another round of validation. <b>This level of flexibility and adaptation is something that simply doesn't exist in the world of legacy systems</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Two additional items to consider that can make or break you endeavor are performance and security.  If you're extending a legacy system that is used by 100 people and all of a sudden make it accessible to 1000, you'll definitely hit a scale problem and you'll see performance go down (of both the original system and the new mobile interface).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In terms of security, besides the obvious user access considerations, you need to think about your data. All of a sudden, the data that was stored inside that old legacy system behind that firewall becomes available on the mobile devices of your users.   This leads to architecture choice.  And if you decided to go for a native application approach, it is more likely that some of that your data will be stored in the user's phone! When we consider the number of <a href="http://dailyinfographic.com/lost-smartphones-really-add-up-infographic">phones that are lost or stolen every year</a>, the risk of information leakage gets really frightening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Keep your legacy safe:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Instead of heading down a path that will increase your technical debt and induce performance/security related heart-burn, <b><i>consider stabilizing your legacy systems</i></b> <b><i>- that is, don't change them. Leave them alone!</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Leaving your legacy systems intact allows you to keep the value you have built into them over the years without the risk of "breaking" them, and you will keep the maintenance and operational costs stable. They were built to last, so don't try to change them!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>If you got to this point, then you're ready to start thinking about extending your legacy with a mobile layer</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Build a mobile layer that's prepared to change:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With your legacy system untouched and stabilized where it should be, you can start thinking about extending it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The approach is relatively straightforward (although not simple):</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: -0.25in;">Leverage your system's APIs to access data and functionality, by creating a set of integration services that use those APIs and that provide caching, synchronization and security;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: -0.25in;">Create a set of business services that will be used to implement the business functionality in your mobile application;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: -0.25in;">Focus on designing highly usable mobile interfaces that will lead to high user adoption.</span></li>
</ol>
<!--[if !supportLists]-->
<p class="MsoNormal">By doing 1 and 2 you'll be creating an important foundation of software components that can be reused in other applications. That will set the base for a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that you can then grow to leverage previous investments and deliver more applications faster and cheaper.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Step 3 requires some additional understanding of UX, and that's enough for an entire series of posts, so we'll leave it for another time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ultimate trick to make this all work is to ensure that, whatever you're building, it needs to be extremely flexible and ready change.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Examples from the real world:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It always seems a long way form talking about it to actually making it happen, and the best way to really understand if this works is to see examples of how others have done it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week we ran a webinar with our partner Conigent, where they took the audience through the case study of a mobile application they built for <a href="http://www.sheetz.com/main/">Sheetz</a>, that extended their ERP, built in record time with the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the words of Ameet Shah, <a href="http://www.conigent.com/">Conigent</a> CEO, "We were able to deliver highly differentiating applications at record speed, without modifying source code of the ERP application and all the while we were doing this while maintaining quality and preventing ourselves to ever refer to these applications as legacy applications".</p>

		<title>Functional Requirements and Their Poor Cousins: The Truth About Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 130%; font-family: arial,helvetica,hirakakupro-w3,osaka,'ms pgothic',sans-serif; font-size: 1.5625em;"><b>W</b></span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 130%;">henever anybody says Functional Requirement, I think of princesses. I think of Ariel and Cinderella. I think of how each is central to her story and embodies a specific identity, and then I think of the princess who stands out as a true metaphor for functional requirements - the one who reflects the role perfectly. I think of Snow White.<!--more--></span>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 10pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/snow-white-10dwarfs12.jpg" alt="snow-white-10dwarfs.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" /></span>

Snow White is a functional requirement if I ever saw one. She is at once central to her story, its main protagonist, its <i>raison d'etre</i>, yet surrounded by a host of supporting characters - dwarfs - whose roles are necessary for the story to be complete.  No dwarfs, no real story. It's that simple. If a single dwarf is missing, the entire story is compromised. Snow White is compromised.

And it's nearly the same with applications. If an application is the story and Snow White is the functional requirement, then we can think of dwarfs as non- functional requirements (NFRs). If a single NFR is missing from an application then that application is compromised. Deploying a squirrely application is the same as adding maintenance issues and technical debt directly to your application portfolio. Eventually, that application will have to be addressed, those NFRs will have to be added, and the IT department who deployed the app will have to contend with the cost of changing software.

How does this happen? Changing and maintaining software is hard and therefore expensive to do and IT departments are often rushed or underfunded. However, if they are in a 'Just do it' mode then those operational, non-functional requirements that make an application
complete are easy to leave out or are 'forgotten.' The consequences of leaving these NFRs out of an application lead directly to the
aforementioned maintenance problems and increased technical debt.

Here's the list of most common NFRs that we see our customers worrying about:
<table width="630">

<td style="padding-right: 30px;" valign="top">5. <b>Flexibility</b>
<p align="left">If the organization intends to increase or extend the functionality of the software after it is deployed, that should be planned from the beginning; it influences choices made during the design, development, testing, and deployment of the system.

Like Snow White's dwarfs these NFRs are necessary to completing the story of the application. While you might consider 2 or 3 important NFRs for a project (like performance and security), you'll probably not cover the others extensively enough, or you might miss out on them all together.

And if you do allocate time to deal with them all, when the project schedule slips, the NFRs may be the first thing you'll drop... because no one really sees them, and your team will be looking at the functional requirements instead.

So, whether you plan for NFRs or not, chances are high you won't cover them 100% of the time in your development project. You'll compromise and not think of the whole story - the whole application.

But you should try. You should try to avoid adding technical debt and maintenance nightmares to your future portfolio whenever possible. The cost of change is real, and the moment you deploy your app, you'll have to address its problems.

From your experience what are the NFRs you constantly see developers and project teams dropping most often?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Goncalo,
Nice story above almost as nice as Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
Most NFR I encounter are:
- scalability (easy hackable environments for as far as you may call it hacking)
- inconsistent interface (a very common one)
a. button or icon (when should you provide the user with a delete button and when will you display a red cross for a delete action)
b. To pop-up or not to pop-up (popping up drills down the level blurring the higher level but it also provides some technical hassle sometimes. (NotifyWidgetGetMessage())
You don't want to slow the interface down just because you need to make like 4 web calls in order to make the interface refresh properly.
- bad (re)use of common libraries
Cheers!
Eric

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Eric,
When you say scalability and relate it to "easy hackable environments", I'm more inclined to relating it to Reliability, which is more related to how tolerant the system is in case something goes wrong in the process (e.g. if a third party system is unresponsive or lacking performance, how can I 1) troubleshoot and be aware the problem is there and 2) ensure my own system does not fall apart because of that). Not only creating less point of failures, but monitoring them is key there. I read one book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers" rel="nofollow">Release It</a>) a bunch of years ago that gives great, real examples on this. Worth the read.
On the inconsistent interface... I think its really about Usability. And it is definitely one that is usually put aside. I believe the main reason it is "forgotten" is because, as Software Engineers, we struggle to find proper scientific education on the rules of usability. It is something that still lies in the field of UX or Visual Design... For all others, there are strict engineering practices to address them (just search for software architecture and you'll find tons of info to add up to what you've learned in college). For usability, it's a totally different story. Whatever is out there is mainly for public, consumer facing, web sites. But on Enterprise applications this is getting more and more important as the expectations of the users are exactly at the same level as the one they have when they use online consumer sites... Will IT ever be able to provide the same level of experience in their complex enterprise applications?
Cheers

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love the analogy, Goncalo. I've found the changing the terminology can improve things too: instead of "non-functional requirements", which sounds like they don't do much, the term "operational features" helps Ops and Dev to talk about these requirements in the same way as with end-user features.
I blogged about this here:
<a href="http://blog.softwareoperability.com/2013/04/08/lets-talk-about-operational-features-not-non-functional-requirements/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.softwareoperability.com/2013/04/08/lets-talk-about-operational-features-not-non-functional-requirements/</a>
In particular, the operational features are scheduled alongside end-user features for sprints/iterations, and the product owner takes responsibility for the operability of the software, as well as delivery of end-user features.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color: #000000;"><b>E</b></span>arlier this year we posted an article about <a title="IT failures post" href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/02/the-hat-trick-of-it-failure-maintenance-backlogs-change.html">IT 'failures'</a> and discussed why inefficiency in most IT departments was really due to the cost of changing and maintaining existing applications.  This cost results in ever-increasing backlogs and an increase in technical debt. <b></b>

In this post, let's take a closer look at the current approaches most IT departments are using to solve their backlogs and why those approaches correlate directly with IT's inability to respond to business requests.

<!--more-->

At first glance it stands out that the way companies currently deal with their backlogs and technical debt is just not working.  Too many IT departments are challenged with unsustainable business models that render them ineffective, or in some cases, irrelevant.  They are in danger of being relegated to little more than cost centers.  And in that state, they are unable to support companies hoping to differentiate through innovative tech.

This is unfortunate because most IT departments are probably doing the best they can.  The problem is simply that current techniques and tools used for delivering and maintaining enterprise systems are hard to use, and the applications these tools deliver are hard to maintain.  This context creates an expensive and unmaintainable problem.

Today, when a business unit needs a new application, or a new piece of functionality in an existing application, your typical IT department responds in one of four ways.  At best these approaches kick the can down the road. At worst, they add to the problem by creating an architecture and technical environment that will be unresponsive and unable to adapt to changing business needs.

Let's look at current approaches to software change:
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 1.3em;"><strong>1. Buy, and Customize, a Packaged Application</strong>.</p>
<strong>Consequence:</strong> When an organization chooses to buy a packaged application such as SAP or other ERP, payroll or CRM solutions, they are buying into pre-defined functionality that delivers best of breed standard processes for the industry/market it serves. More often than not, organizations find that their processes are somewhat different from what the package offers, and therefore must customize the package. The problem is that packages have not been built for change and customizing packaged applications is hard, expensive, can require hundreds or thousands of consulting hours, and will create a maintenance nightmare that possibly hinders future package upgrades.
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 1.3em;"><strong>2. Build a Custom Solution Using In-house Developers or System Integrators.</strong></p>
<b>Consequence:<i> </i></b>The problem with this approach is that building a large system using the current state of techniques and tools is complex and expensive.  In many situations, the organizations then fall hostage to the system integrators who built the application, because they are the only ones that know how to maintain it. In any case, enterprise applications are never "built for change".  The urgency and focus on getting an application deployed, using current techniques, produces a solution that is not easy to change, and is often prone to break when you do.  This just ends up being a big add-on to existing technical debt.
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 1.3em;"><strong>3. Select and 'Rent' a Cloud-based Solution (SaaS).</strong></p>
<b>Consequence</b>: With the advent of software-as-a-service (SaaS), companies are resorting more and more to 'renting' cloud-based applications to satisfy business requirements. By the very nature of the model, SaaS applications offer small degrees of parameterization, and with the exception of a couple of very large vendors, no customization options. To a degree, this is a blessing in that IT tends to use SaaS "as-is" and therefore limits maintenance requirements. It does not, however, address the requirement for custom functionality - namely interfaces, workflows and data repositories that are unique to nearly every organization.
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 1.3em;"><strong>4. Do Nothing!</strong></p>
<b>Consequence: </b>When budget, time or resources are not available to buy or build the needed application, IT often just says "No" to the business. When the IT department chooses to do nothing, it causes its relevance to decrease even further<b> and results in the creation of...</b>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 1.3em;"><b>Shadow IT</b></p>
When the pressure to come up with a solution for the business is intense, and IT can't deliver what is needed, business teams often decide to take matters into their own hands. This is commonly known as "shadow IT" - applications built, installed or rented outside of IT's control. Typical approaches include using departmental 'wiz kids' or finding hired guns to solve the problem.  They may use platforms such as force.com or SharePoint to develop and deliver an application to solve the business problem. Or they may use portal, workflow or collaboration tools - or even deliver completely bespoke applications, built using any number of tools or languages.

With cloud-based offerings delivered as a 'service', the business does not necessarily need to involve IT at all - there is nothing to install, nothing to back-up, no disaster recovery considerations, data conversion can be outsourced - business can solve the problem without IT even knowing the application exists.

However, as these applications are adopted and begin to grow, the complexity of changing them and/or the inherent value of the data being maintained by them, forces the business to turn control of the applications over to IT.

Looking at these approaches dealing with backlogs, one can see that none of them are particularly desirable and they are replete with cost issues, control issues, and scalability issues. Yet, despite their futility, time and again, organizations continue to walk down the same trodden paths expecting to arrive somewhere different - or maybe they feel like there is no other path to take?

The fact is there's always a new trail to blaze.  In an ideal world, you would not have to worry about the cost of change. You would simply focus on delivering the application your business needs, and know that it would only slightly increase your maintenance costs. In order to do that, you'd need to use technology and an approach that could ensure a flat cost of change across the entire lifecycle of your applications.

In a future post, we'll examine how these same approaches, when thought of differently, can be made to improve IT productivity and the ability to support business innovation.  In the meanwhile, for those interested in reading more about what holds IT back from innovation, download our featured white paper on the <a href="http://bit.ly/180OWE0">struggles of IT to innovate</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I</strong>n today's information-centric world, as web applications become more widespread and increasingly transactional, more and more corporate data and business logic are at risk. It has become necessary - in a way it's never been before - to ensure that every single line does not introduce a vulnerability and that every single software application - whether built for desktop, cloud or mobile -- is safe from cyber-attacks and that your intellectual property, customer data (credit card numbers, SSN, addresses, etc.), business processes and trade secrets are protected.

<!--more-->

With so much at risk - money, reputation, legal issues - organizations today agree that application security is a top concern. In some businesses specific regulation exists, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_DSS" target="">PCI DSS</a>, for payment cards cardholder information handling.  This regulation requires compliance to well-defined security standards as an imperative to conducting business.

Security must be accounted for at all layers - from network to application software. It takes a single unsecure pathway to private information to make an entire system vulnerable! The goal, of course, is to eliminate exploitable security risks in software at the application code level and ensure that <b><i>all</i></b> pathways to data are secure, and no vulnerabilities would allow a website to be abused for the purposes of spreading malware.

Hackers are known to be ingenious in discovering new entry points along these pathways. They started years ago at the network and hardware levels, but since firewalls and other network devices have closed many gaps, they are now going directly to the application layer.

This means that code security is <b><i>key</i></b> to ensuring secure applications, but as everyone in the development space knows, the gulf between development and security is not easily bridged.  This is unfortunate as it's more effective - not to mention cheaper - to solve security problems during the development phase of a project.  According to an NIST study, the cost of fixing security issues in software increases substantially further along the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to the point that<a href="http://www.network1tv.com.br/downloads/pdf/20120905_nw1_muzilli_hp_v2.pdf"> it costs 30x more to fix security issues</a> after a breach in production than to build security into your code at the beginning of software design.

One way organizations are driving their security efforts is through the use of security testing tools to identify all potentially exploitable vulnerabilities in software at the application code level. Developers and security experts then team up to review these (usually very extensive) vulnerability lists, and fix those that the team agrees should be addressed, according to occurrence frequency, exploit complexity, and potential impact. These reviews require a huge amount of effort - in time, resources, and expertise - and they need to be undertaken every time an organization needs to deploy a new and secure release of an application.

With the release of the latest<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/res/hp-fortify-outsystems-case-study"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1936 size-full" style="margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;" title="Download OutSystems Success Story with HP Fortify" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hp-fortify-outsystems-case-study-thumb.png" alt="HP Fortify OutSystems Case Study" width="200" height="259" /></a> <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/" target="">OutSystems Platform</a> version, things are a bit different. For the past decade, results from every security test - code vulnerability scans, runtime analysis scans, penetration tests - that customers have performed on code generated by our platform have been incorporated back into the platform.  That is ten years of accumulated intelligence and improved security. Ten years of security testing ... all that knowledge accumulated over the years instantly made available to developers from the moment they begin developing a new application. It's all in the platform and is an inherent part of every application every customer deploys.

Taking our approach to application security one step further, we've recently integrated a security testing tool - <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1338812#.UYJGYbWG0WI" target="">HP Fortify Static Code Analyzer</a> - directly into our quality assurance process. By making this security review a part of our product delivery processes, and by enforcing an aggressive acceptance criteria (no critical, no high, no medium reported occurrence left behind) we are able to systematically ensure that the applications generated with the OutSystems Platform - both Java and .NET applications - are inherently secure. When it comes to code vulnerabilities, fix once, fixed forever.

Continuous monitoring and improvement of our platform - along with regular client feedback and regular vulnerability updates from HP - means that application security grows stronger with every iteration.

It's like having a security expert in-a-box. Even if your developers don't have the knowledge or the time to properly address code security, your applications are designed and built as if they were developed by security experts. That's one less <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/03/the-truth-about-non-functional-requirements-nfrs.html" target="">NFR (non-functional requirement)</a> you need to worry about.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/" target="_blank">NextStep user conference</a> was all about creating great user experiences on enterprise web and mobile applications, and we were pleased to host usability guru Steve Krug to the speaker line-up as keynote.
<p style="text-align: left;">Over several days Steve spoke and led workshops for hundreds of participants.</p>
<!--more--><img class="alignright" style="text-align: center;" alt="UXforIT.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UXforIT11.jpg" width="167" height="166" />
<p style="text-align: left;">Steve is perhaps best known as the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366985423&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Don%27t+Make+Me+Think%3A+A+Common+Sense+Approach+to+Web+Usability." target="_blank">Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.</a>  This book has more than 350,000 copies in print and is in it's second edition.  His latest book is the usability testing handbook, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Do-It-Yourself/dp/0321657292/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y" target="_blank">Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems.</a></p>
Both books are based on the 20-plus years Steve has spent as a usability consultant for a wide variety of clients, including Apple, Bloomberg.com, Lexus.com, NPR, the International Monetary Fund, and others.  His consulting firm, <a href="http://www.sensible.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Common Sense</a> ("just me and a few well-placed mirrors"), is based in Chestnut Hill, MA.  Steve spends most of his time teaching usability workshops, consulting, and watching old episodes of "Law and Order".

During the conference we had an opportunity to sit down with Steve to discuss industry trends and such.  The following are some highlights from that discussion:

<span style="color: #808080;"><b style="line-height: 1.62;">Michel Ozzello:</b></span><strong><em><span style="line-height: 1.62;"> What are a couple of things every technology company can do to make usability more central to their development - and if they are not already doing that, why do you think that is the case?</span></em></strong>

<span style="color: #808080;"><b>Steve Krug:</b></span> I think there are basically two routes to boosting the amount of commitment to usability. Either (a) get a powerful advocate somewhere very close to the top of the corporate ladder who decides that usability is going to be part of everyone's job <i>and</i> allocates the time and budget to make it happen, or (b) start small and grow virally. The second case is the one that interests me the most, because it's the one that almost anyone who believes in the value of usability can have a hand in. (You can always <i>try</i> to convince management to drink the user experience Kool-Aid, but I think it's usually something they have to discover on their own.)

I have to admit that I'm one of those guys who own a hammer so everything looks like a nail to me: I think that the best way to "infect" an organization with the UX bug is by getting as many people as possible to watch some live usability tests - even one or two.

A lot of the people I know who run usability tests for a living talk about it as a conversion experience: people watching their first usability tests often just suddenly "get it" that (a) regardless of what they thought before, all users are <i>not</i> like them, and (b) people have a much harder time figuring out how to use things than we like to think (i.e., they spend a lot of time just muddling through). So all of a sudden, it becomes clear that to produce something that people will enjoy using (and something that doesn't generate tons of frustration and support calls), we have to invest a lot more care, thought, and testing into the design of the things we build.

Why do I think most companies still don't pay enough attention to creating good user experience? I guess there have always been a lot of reasons. For instance, historically you've always been much more likely to get fired for shipping a product that's buggy or lacking crucial features than one that frustrates people. And UX research (e.g. usability testing) always had a reputation for being expensive and potentially slowing down development, although I think that's changing as people realize that lighter weight "guerilla" methods can be just as effective. Also, usability is a relatively new concept for a lot of people, so it's never been an indispensable line-item in development budgets. Who knows? Maybe it'll achieve that status in the next few years--mostly thanks to the influence of Apple.

<span style="color: #808080;"><b>MOZ:</b></span> <em><strong>How do you see the discipline of Usability trending in the next few years?  What is going to matter?</strong></em>

<span style="color: #808080;"><b>KRUG:</b></span> I think--or at least I hope--that it's going to become much less of a thing that only specialists do and more something that <i>everyone</i> does. For instance, I think that any degree program for developers or designers should include a course in user experience (I think most people could learn what they need to know in a semester). Not that there won't be plenty of work for specialists, just that they'll be doing more advanced work, coming up with new interaction ideas, and teaching everyone else.

<span style="color: #808080;"><b style="line-height: 1.62;">MOZ:</b></span><em><strong><span style="line-height: 1.62;"> Tell us about </span>Rocket Surgery Made Easy<span style="line-height: 1.62;">. Is a handbook for usability testing important today? At this point in the evolution of the web, do you find that people are still getting usability wrong?</span></strong></em>

<span style="color: #808080;"><b>KRUG:</b></span> Well, we're back to me and my hammer again: I think that everyone who's building something that people interact with should be doing some form of usability testing, whether it's bringing in a few people once a month or just doing frequent "hallway" tests where you grab somebody for a few minutes and ask them to try using whatever you're working on at the moment. I mainly wrote <i>Rocket Surgery</i> for people who want to do some usability testing even though it's not their "real" job. So I spelled out a complete formula for how to do testing that's quick and efficient, but still almost always produces more valuable design insights than you can use.

And it's not so much that people are getting usability <i>wrong</i>; it's more that it's almost impossible to get all of usability <i>right,</i> at least on the first try. It's really hard, and with possible exception of the occasional genius designer (one of those unicorns people are always trying to recruit, like designers who code and developers who design), nobody can get it completely right without doing some usability testing.

<span style="color: #808080;"><b style="line-height: 1.62;">MOZ:</b></span><strong><em><span style="line-height: 1.62;"> What have been some of your takeaways from the OutSystems conference?</span></em></strong>

<span style="color: #808080;"><b>KRUG:</b></span>To name just a few:
<ul>
	<li>People in Lisbon are really nice and smart.  I already knew this from a previous visit, but it was fun to learn it all over again.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I never realized that almost all the developers coding enterprise applications have to do their own design work.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I didn't know there was a company out there that took my books as seriously as the folks at OutSystems. It was really gratifying to see what can happen when an organization makes usability a top priority.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I loved some of the usability features they "cooked" into Platform 8. My favorite is probably the way they found to "automate" optimal vertical spacing in designs. I started out as a typesetter originally, so vertical spacing (or "leading") has always been an obsession for me, and I know just how much of a difference it can make for readers/users, and how hard it can be for even designers to get right. So I was really tickled to see that they'd come up with a feature that just does the right thing, without the person building the app having to think about it at all. Honestly, I was blown away by it.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.62;">Also, some folks at OutSystems put together an excellent PDF called "</span><a style="line-height: 1.62;" href="http://www.outsystems.com/ux-for-it/" target="_blank">11 Usability Rules for IT Developers</a><span style="line-height: 1.62;">" that has some of the best basic usability advice I've ever seen. </span></li>

		<title>User Experience: The New IT Imperative?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[May was definitely UX month at OutSystems! During our yearly user conference, attendees from around the world participated in dozens of sessions to define and discuss the quality of Great Apps and what it takes to create them.

Usability expert Steve Krug, author of "Don't Make me Think," and "Rocket Surgery Made Easy," gave a talk and workshops around the importance of user testing. Version 8 of the OutSystems Platform was unveiled, showcasing the addition of a powerful new user interface editor in the IDE that simplifies the creation of highly usable interfaces, as well as other change management and operational enhancements.

<!--more-->

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>But Why Usability? Why User Experience?</strong></span>

The difference between helping enterprises release applications into production and enabling them to create powerful applications that are widely adopted is based on their usability and user experience. This year's conference was about understanding the power of the Great App in the modern workplace.

It is clear that since the early 2000s Apple has raised the bar on user experience. The mass adoption of their products proved there was genuine demand for it and since then, everything about the way people expect to experience technology has changed. This is known as the consumerization of IT and is itself the topic of discussion at events like this year's CITE 2013.

All of this is only to say that...

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>User Experience Has Become a Corporate Asset</strong></span>

A corporate asset the same way real estate, intellectual property, and brand identity are. At this point in time most enterprises have been, at least, socialized to this idea. With mobile proliferation worth billions of dollars and BYOD projections equaling billions more, people are bringing their high tech devices to work <strong>with the EXPECTATION that enterprise applications will at least work as well as what they use at home</strong>.

So, as <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/04/why-it-needs-to-change-its-approach-to-responding-to-business-needs.html" target="_self">we've written often in this blog</a>, if IT wants to stay relevant to their organizations, they are going to need to not only respond to user needs, but proactively cater to them. If they want to extend applications to the boundaries where workers exist, and if they are interested in delivering enterprise apps to mobile devices, and also have them adopted by users, then they are going to have to <a title="Scale UX strategy" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/01/scaling_your_ux_strategy.html" target="_blank">scale their UX strategy</a>.

The benefits to business are too valuable not to! The cost savings alone are enough to justify implementing formal usability concerns. According to the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails" target="_blank">IEEE</a>, 15% of all projects are abandoned, and of the top twelve reasons projects fail, three are <a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/bitpakkit/267487/roi-ux" target="_blank">directly related</a> to not getting user experience right. Whether it's bad usability testing, user centered design, or project management, getting user experience in-house and under control is as imperative today as extending brand identity.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>But How Can Organizations Get IT Developers to Begin Thinking About Design?</strong></span>

Developers will not have time to become usability experts, nor should they. However, it's still important for them to learn some basic concepts in order to make an application better.

For starters, IT developers and software engineers could start by learning more about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dln9xDsmCoY" target="_blank">user centered design</a>. In fact, it's imperative that developers understand the key concepts behind usability and the value those principles will bring to their apps.

From there it's also important to know that successful applications have 3 key characteristics:
<ul>
	<li>They are high quality (work with no bugs)</li>
	<li>They are high performance (work as fast as possible)</li>
	<li>They are highly usability (easy to work with)</li>
</ul>
Although quality and performance should already be part of any developer's checklist, usability is something relatively new and not natural for a developer. However it is key to user adoption and therefore shouldn't be dismissed, but embraced!

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>So Why Do IT Teams Tend To Jump Over Usability?</strong></span>

Two reasons:
<ol>
	<li>They believe that adding usability concerns to their projects will considerably extend their project's duration, and they are already struggling with time.</li>
	<li>They don't have in-house resources, and hiring external usability consultants is considered too expensive</li>
</ol>
The problem with this line of thinking is that there's nothing worse than delivering a business application and realizing that users won't adopt it because it isn't usable. By making certain developers are the first in line to think and worry about the usability of applications - preferably while developing - IT departments will be setting the path for higher user adoption rates at lower costs. So, while developing an application, your IT team should understand two points:
<ol>
	<li>Regarding costs, applications don't have to be developed to 100% usability. Investments can be made to those parts of the application that are used 80% of the time, or areas that present serious UX problems. Low cost usability testing is also available, as described in Krugs', "Rocket Surgery Made Easy."</li>
	<li>To help your team with resources necessary to continue on this journey, we have developed a "<a title="Ux for IT" href="http://www.outsystems.com/ux-for-it/" target="_self">UX-for-IT</a>" initiative that includes a toolkit that was especially designed to help IT departments adopt and scale their UX strategies. It contains an eBook outlining 11 usability principles for developers, along with examples. There's also a Vision Document Template, useful in helping IT teams understand and collaborate with their users when they begin building applications. We also included an easy to use UX checklist for aligning the build process to best practices.</li>
</ol>
There is no reason not to think about usability. Application development without user adoption as the ultimate goal is simply wasted effort. With usability considered from the beginning, IT departments can ensure that the efforts they are making are applied to the businesses needs.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Innovating in a Digital World</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>As we slowly climb out of recession, businesses are starting to jostle for position in order to get one step ahead of the competition in the upturn. As a result, many organisations are now striving for 'digital innovation' to help take their organisations forward.</strong>

In fact a report by the <a title="National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach" href="http://niesr.ac.uk/publications/measuring-uk%E2%80%99s-digital-economy-big-data#.UjwsJD-Pt-o" target="_blank">National Institute of Economic and Social Research</a> found that there are at least<strong> 270,000 digital companies in Britain and revenue repor<strong>ted by digital companies is growing 25% faster than that reported by non-digital companies</strong>.</strong>

<!--more--><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="Innovating In A Digital World " src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Digital-Innovation-28012.jpg" width="280" height="259" />

There's clear evidence that going digital is no longer exclusive to either the bigger brands or the tiny dotcoms or biotech start-ups - it is no longer niche but now all-pervasive. Embracing digital channels is a must for firms to compete and survive regardless of size or industry.<strong>
</strong>

According to a survey of 350 CEOs by analyst company Gartner, more than <strong>50% of organisations now have a digital strategy in place</strong>. For some, digital is paying off but many more organisations are still unsure how they can capitalise on digital and who owns digital within the organisation.

Historically, business functions such as marketing and customer contact services were seen as the early adopters and today's driver in a firm's digital strategy and capability. And for that reason they are often given ownership of the company's digital strategy - but should digital sit with marketing or another line of business or in fact sit with IT?

For any organisation's digital strategy to succeed it requires true collaboration across all business functions from the supply chain, to marketing to sales, to operations and it is IT that provides the glue that brings all these different functions together.

Another reason why it should sit with IT is that wherever possible most organisations want to avoid 'shadow or stealth IT' emerging as this brings with it another set of problems, for example often IT solutions are not in line with the organisation's requirements for control, documentation, security, reliability, etc. I believe that the IT department needs to works seamlessly together with the various lines of business to bring the organisation's digital strategy to life and make sure that the IT department doesn't get side-lined.

However, embracing digital requires IT to think more like a front-office innovator rather than a back-office cost-centre. It also requires IT to think about how digital will fit with the company's more traditional IT strategy. Some say that IT is not fit to provide this new digital innovation but I think this is more of a mind-set challenge. IT needs to recognise that focusing purely on 'keeping the lights on' and managing the status quo simply won't cut it.

Today IT still gets far too bogged down in management and maintenance, which leaves very little scope for new digital innovations. This leads to the perception that IT can't innovate or take leadership of new initiatives like digital. According to Gartner, at least 80% of the IT budget is still spent on maintenance (yes this statistic hasn't changed).

I believe that IT does have the ability to drive innovation and take a lead on all things IT related including the organisation's digital strategy. In order to do so however IT needs to look closely at how it is working, it needs to look at creating a more agile IT environment, and it must look at the role that advanced technology solutions can play - all of which can help to release IT from its technology shackles.

With greater freedom will then come increased focus on digital innovation and an ability for IT to take exciting new digital projects to market fast. The creation of a totally integrated digital strategy won't happen overnight. IT will need to build a more agile IT environment one that has the ability to adapt to business change quickly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.</strong></p>
From the laptop to the laws of gravity, British ingenuity has shaped our world and we have a strong history of championing new ideas, innovations and inventions.

Britain's capacity to excel in research and development has continued to be at the heart of our economic growth and today we are still one of the world's leading innovators.

<!--more--><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="Innovation Nation" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/innovation-nation12.jpg" width="300" height="199" />

As we slowly start to climb out of recession, growth prospects remain at the mercy of continued budget constraints combined with a growing IT skills shortage. Thinking about our legacy as a powerhouse of discovery and invention, it is clear to me that the only way that we can get out of today's economic malaise is by continuing to invest in sustainable innovation. However, where IT is concerned, I think that's easier said than done.
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">But before we talk in more detail about innovation, I think I need to stress that innovation doesn't need to be 'big bang' or about radical change or an amazing new invention. <strong>Innovation is simply a new way of doing something</strong>. Whether a new feature, a new service or a new process, innovation is often about incremental progress, which enables the business to work more effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">According to CIO Magazine, <strong>business process improvements and increasing IT capacity to drive innovation is top of the list of most frequently cited IT management priorities</strong>. However, according to <a title="ITWire" href="http://www.itwire.com/sponsored-announcements/59058-5-biggest-challenges-facing-cios-in-2013" target="_blank">IT Wire.com</a>, over 25 per cent of all CIOs also list innovation and technological change as one of the biggest challenges facing them in 2013.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>So why does IT struggle to innovate? Or to put it another way, why does the business perceive that IT can't innovate?</strong></p>
I believe <strong>there are two mitigating factors:</strong>
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">The first is that according to <a title="Gartner" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/497088" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, at least <strong>80 per cent of the IT budget is still spent on keeping the lights on (KTLO)</strong>. So if the total spend on enterprise-wide IT is likely to be $2.68 trillion (as cited in a recent New York Times article), and 80 per cent of this spend is allocated to what is essentially maintenance, you get the picture in terms of how much KTLO costs.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">The second factor impacting IT's ability to innovate is around the accumulation of new service or change requests made by business units, which puts a massive strain on IT resource. This creates an inevitable<strong> IT backlog</strong> that becomes a crippling problem and can result in a failure to deliver.</li>
</ul>
IT departments are then often seen to be incompetent, slow, and by default unable to support innovation. The real failure here, however, is actually a lack of budget and resource, not incompetence or an inability to innovate.

To further compound the problem, current techniques and tools used for delivering enterprise systems are expensive as well as hard to use and maintain. When the business needs a new application, IT typically responds in one of four ways. It buys and customises a packaged application, it builds a customer solution using in-house developers or system integrators, it rents a cloud based solution that don't need IT's involvement, or it simply does nothing.

When IT chooses to do nothing it causes its relevance to decrease even further and results in the creation of shadow IT - applications built, installed or rented outside of IT's control. All approaches are replete with cost, control and scalability issues technology debt grows and backlogs get bigger and IT departments get further marginalised unable to help the company innovate.

Yet despite the futility of these approaches, time and again, organisations continue to walk down the same path and expect to arrive somewhere different. This has to change;<strong> IT has the ability to innovate in so many ways, if only given the chance</strong>.

If we redefine the problem, the root cause of these IT troubles is all to do with the cost of changing software. Delivering new applications is time consuming and expensive. Additionally the cost of change is not limited to the delivery of the final version, as soon as the application goes live it immediately goes into maintenance mode.

According to Gartner, when looking at the lifetime cost of building or buying a new application, on <strong>average 42 per cent of the initial cost of the application is spent year on year maintaining that application</strong>, therefore application maintenance is the real problem. In order to solve this problem <strong>IT departments need to take control of the cost of change</strong>.

This requires a complete transformation whereby IT redefines its approach to every application in its portfolio and strategically thinks about how to respond to business requests. This transformation won't happen overnight but gradually it can take the IT department from being a scapegoat and an irrelevance to a centre of excellence and innovation.

		<title>Is UX your Achilles heel?</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/08/is-ux-your-achilles-heel.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Today, user experience (UX) has become 'the new black' in product and application development with many organisations embracing a '<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/03/inside-facebooks-internal-inno/" target="_blank">build and prototype</a>' culture.</strong></p>
This is quite a sea-change from as little as five years ago when UX wasn't really on anyone's radar apart from the likes of renowned innovators like Steve Jobs. He was always obsessed with the customer experience and very much in the 'nitty gritty' of product design.

<!--more--><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="Usability Matters" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ux2.jpg" width="300" height="289" />

I remember when I did my degree in Computer Science 15 years ago - we literally had one UX module in the whole course curriculum. Astounding, isn't it? Look at any computer science course today and UX is everywhere, in every single module, and completely integrated into the coursework syllabus.

So what does this mean for any developer with more than 10 years' experience? I imagine that this new UX culture is causing some anxiety. <strong>Today you can't be a developer without having UX experience</strong>, but if you're an older generation developer, you won't have been taught about UX. This will be your Achilles heel. And believe me, you can't just acquire these skills overnight.

<strong>UX is an unusual combination of both art and science</strong>. It requires a cross-functional capability and new ways of thinking - a developer that appreciates good design, and a designer that understands application development. Engineers need to work in computing languages, but think in human experience.
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">This combined talent doesn't naturally sit together. Sure, the new kids on the block might have both skills engrained because they've learnt this from the outset; the more seasoned developers, not so much.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>So why is it so important to incorporate UX into the development process?</strong></p>
From my perspective applications fail not because they are functionally poor but because they have been adopted poorly. You can have a great, functionally rich product, but if the users don't adopt it, the product is obsolete and serves no purpose. We are also a generation that wants instant gratification - plug and play technology.

Think about it - <strong>when you use any application, if it takes more than a few milliseconds to respond then you'll view that as a bad user experience</strong>. The best products are those that have simplicity designed into them. Look at Apple, Google, Twitter, Fly.com - all these brands are incredibly user friendly and simple to use.

But to be successful, UX can't be an afterthought or a bolt on, it has to be at the forefront of your development strategy. It needs to be in the culture of the business and the development teams.

<strong>Good UX is ultimately about understanding your users' experience</strong>. And I don't mean asking them to get involved in the features and technical spec. This is more about engagement, observing, asking questions and looking to understand user needs. To use a car analogy, it's about the driving experience, the look and feel, the design spec, it's not about what's under the bonnet.

Live testing is a great usability barometer. Developers watching their first live test often find the experience a revelation. They instantly get that (a) regardless of what they thought before, all users are not just like them and (b) people have a much harder time figuring out how to use products than we think.
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">So it becomes clear that to design something that people want to use (without getting frustrated) you need to invest a lot more care, thought and testing into the design process. Ultimately, I view UX like a scientific experiment.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Success depends on four key components</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">You need to start with your <strong>research</strong> - for example, conduct a UX audit that captures the sequence of interactions your customers need to take to complete basic tasks with key products. Then involve the users along the way, using live <strong>testing</strong> to really understand their requirements - you'll be surprised at how fast applications fail in the hands of your users - so test, test, and test again.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Your UX approach requires a methodology with change at the heart of the product development and deployment process. You need a development environment that will allow you to <strong>rapidly accommodate change</strong>, one that is flexible and can work within the ebb and flow of the UX process.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Most importantly you need<strong> plug and play technology</strong> that allows you to seamlessly integrate best of breed design and best of breed development into your systems, which is where we can help.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">And finally, you also need to develop more of a <strong>risk-taking culture</strong> that encourages your development team to explore and experiment. While I understand the anxiety of developers who perhaps haven't had UX engrained into their culture, I hope I have demonstrated that there are tools, support and ways to overcome this.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Let's face it, the consequence of not having UX as a central part of your development strategy can be catastrophic; building a product that never gets adopted.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>So developers, don't let UX be your Achilles heel; embrace it, understand it and adopt it. </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></p>

		<title>Is the Train Late? Liberating Siloed Data for Commuters in Rotterdam</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/09/liberating-siloed-data-in-rotterdam.html</link>

As IT professionals, we are always happy to know we have delivered technical services that help a business and business users. Seeing a development project come to life and work the way it was designed is rewarding and probably the reason why most IT professionals enjoy their jobs. <!--more-->So, imagine the reward and satisfaction an OutSystems Partner felt after developing software that not only helped out everyday citizens in their hometown, but possibly even helped themselves as they headed off to work.
<div style="float: right; width: 330px; margin-left: 10px;"><img class="alignright" alt="RET" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-25_13591.jpg" width="330" height="250" /></div>
Every day in the city of Rotterdam, 600,000 commuters ride trams, trains, buses and even a ferry around the city. That's <strong>185 million people a year depending on 46 transportation lines and 509 vehicles</strong>. While the system works efficiently and has high rates of customer satisfaction, occasionally an unforeseen event occurs and a line or more is blocked, or a vehicle is put out of commission. While this didn't happen often there was no quick way to get that information to the commuters who needed it most. Commuters were stranded, left to wait and wonder and stare at their watches.

<strong>The solution: an Automated Communication Delivery System built by COOL<em>Profs.</em></strong>

Known for their devoted attention to customer satisfaction and innovating solutions, the Rotterdam Electric Tram Company (RET) knew they had to change this. What they decided they needed was an automated mechanism that notified commuters via multiple communication channels as instantly as possible. They had plenty of logistical data to share in their back office. However, the challenge was creating a single, streamlined communications push outward. The transportation data in RET's IT office was supported by multiple applications ranging from huge enterprise systems like SAP to an aging application maintained by a single developer who had worked on developing it. RET had rostering systems, operational systems, websites and even dynamic information panels to contend with. At the center of all of these applications were an SQL data store and a single travel information agent. <strong>When a line was down, the disruption to the system scaled up and took too long to communicate to customers</strong>.

COOL<em>Profs</em>, an OutSystems partner in the Netherlands, was tasked to create<strong> an automated communication delivery system that would cascade traffic messages to RET's website, Twitter feed, SMS texts, dynamic displays at train stations, tablets for conductors, radio, and even a text to speech option for the hearing impaired</strong>.

Using the OutSystems Platform, COOL<em>Profs</em> was able to integrate all of the existing applications into a single multichannel communication tool. From an operational point of view, any line outage in the system can be announced within two minutes, and RET can maintain the application themselves. Commuters who opt in to receive messages from RET, follow the Twitter feed, or who check the website before leaving home get the same information as if they were standing on a platform in the station watching a dynamic panel. They are never left stranded. They are never left staring at their watches.

For the full story of the RET project, watch the video below. To learn more about how OutSystems can help you put your data into the hands of your customers, visit, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">www.outsystems.com</a>.

		<title>A Cloud Platform before its time</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2001, the group of founders got together and added the last details to the OutSystems business plan. We wanted to solve a big problem: <strong>fix the IT productivity issue</strong> of delivering large Intranet (browser-based internal apps) and Extranet (customer and partner portals and APIs) systems. These projects were plagued with failure, delays and were constantly over budget. We also wanted to ride the one trend we knew would revolutionize enterprise IT: <strong>software systems running on hardware hosted outside the enterprise data center</strong>. In March 2001, OutSystems was born.

<!--more-->

The core idea was to empower the enterprise developer community to develop applications that would run in Application Service Provider data centers. These applications would be created, changed and managed from a remote IDE and a web browser. In short, we went about creating <strong>a development platform and business operation that would be available as a service</strong>.

In 2002, we launched version 1.0 of the OutSystems Platform in partnership with an ASP. Version 1.0 of the platform pushed all normal development operations to the hosted server, thus creating a multi-tenancy platform for developers. We designed a web-based console that would enable developers and operations teams to wrap applications and deploy them into production environments streamlining collaboration between development and operations - now known as DevOps. Today, analyst evaluation criteria for a<strong> high-productivity platform as a service (PaaS)</strong> are uncannily similar to the initial specs of version 1 of the OutSystems product.

It's obvious now that our plan was doomed to fail from day one. We were at the beginning of a bubble-burst recession, and enterprise developers, ops folks and IT in general did not even dream about relinquishing control of development and production environments to the cloud. We had no market. At the time I thought the company was doomed.

Luckily, we had built a product that solved a real problem for the enterprise on an architectural framework that was "enterprise architect-friendly." So we started selling the <strong>OutSystems Platform as an installable on-premises product</strong>. The combination of <strong>high-productivity model-driven development and automated DevOps</strong> proved to be an irresistible combination for developer project teams that wanted to get applications built and delivered fast without having to worry about things like scalability, high-availability and complex operations.
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 15px;"><strong>2003: PaaS-in-a-Box for the enterprise</strong></p>
In 2003, we started selling a "<strong>PaaS in a Box</strong>" directly to enterprise IT groups that were facing the following challenges:
<ul>
	<li>A large application backlog not addressed by packages or SaaS solutions.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Frustration with traditional application development because of unpredictability and delays in delivery and the high costs of built and change.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 15px;"><strong>2003-2012</strong></p>
During the next nine years, we partnered with hundreds of enterprise customers that have delivered thousands of applications. We have shared a long journey with our customers and we have evolved our Platform to tackle the massive application portfolios of our larger customers. There is no situation, problem or challenge we haven't faced and solved.
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 15px;"><strong>The time for the cloud is now</strong></p>
In the past 12 months, we have started seeing the trickle of demand for a high-productivity platform that would work in the cloud. We have decided to go back to our 2001 perception of the future and deliver our original idea. On October 1st 2013, we launched the <strong>OutSystems Platform - Enterprise Cloud, a high-productivity enterprise cloud platform as a service (PaaS)</strong>.

The wait has been long, but there are<strong> some advantages to having a robust technology</strong> that is proven in the market:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Portability between cloud and on-premises</strong>. OutSystems-built applications are represented by a meta-model. That is the core innovation that allows us to package a large enterprise app in a small representation and deploy it across environment stages. We are extending that capability to the cloud. For example, our customers will be able to start developing in the cloud and deploy in an on-premises environment behind the firewall.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>Open to be extended with Java and C# code</strong>. The OutSystems Platform is used to build mission-critical applications at Fortune 500 companies. From day one we have given them warranties of no lock-in. So we decided to follow a code generation philosophy where the Platform generates standard, documented, native, high-performance Java and .NET code. By extending this capability to the cloud, we can offer a PaaS with no proprietary stacks or interpreters, a rare feature in today's landscape of PaaS vendors.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>Enterprise DevOps and impact analysis</strong>. Deploying a small departmental app from dev to production is easy. It is difficult when your app has grown, because it depends on tens of other services and components and the whole thing is shifting and changing. Enterprise DevOps is about managing the life cycle of a large ecosystem of apps and services, orchestrating the work of a lot of people without breaking anything, and delivering high productivity. Our PaaS gives you that.</li>
</ol>
I tell my students and advisees, usually fresh or wanna-be entrepreneurs, that I am equipped to give them advice because of the many mistakes we have made at OutSystems and the many things we have learned by trial and error. In this case, the mistake was timing. I feel embarrassed about that. But the vision was right and I feel very good about that. And I have huge admiration and gratitude for the team that has walked this walk with me for over 10 years... the time now is now ours. Welcome back, to the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Out of all the different cloud computing services, platform as a service (PaaS) has been the slowest growing with many organisations hesitant to adopt. However, this is set to change as leading analysts Gartner and 451 Research estimate PaaS to attain a 41 per cent CAGR through 2016.

<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 20px;" alt="Datacenter" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SIO_DataCenter_Rows12.jpg" width="300" height="200" />However, this is set to change as<strong> PaaS finally appears to be coming into fashion</strong>. In terms of adoption, it's predicted that PaaS will leapfrog other cloud services in the coming years.

Leading analysts <strong>Gartner and 451research.com estimate a steep rise in PaaS adoption, forecasting an increase in spending to more than $2.9 billion by 2016</strong>. Indeed, PaaS is projected to attain a 41 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2016.

<strong>So why has PaaS suddenly become so relevant?</strong>

I think it's largely a reflection that organisations are now more confident about using cloud services in general, especially when they understand that cloud isn't an all or nothing decision. Organisations have the flexibility to move between cloud and on premises as well as to create hybrid solutions.

The move to cloud can be gradual and iterative; you can fire up new projects in the cloud quickly and easily then if you need to, you can bring these back in-house at a later date.

Although the technology may have taken longer to mature than first anticipated, PaaS is showing positive signs of stability as well as security. As a result, those early adopter fears are slowly melting away.<strong> Today organisations realise that PaaS is safe, secure, highly scalable, and extremely cost efficient</strong>.

Looking back, I can remember that after the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, which sadly devastated parts of Thailand, the cost of hard disks went up by 40 per cent practically overnight.

This, combined with the impact of the recession, has had a dramatic impact on how organisations now approach application development. Price increases have had a long-term negative effect on infrastructure and development costs, making it extremely expensive to commission new projects today.

Costs that organisations had been willing to sink into running their IT infrastructure 10 years ago have become unsustainable. The net result is that we have seen many organisations grappling with budgets and priorities, looking for more cost effective ways to support their IT development requirements. As we slowly start to climb out of recession, organisations are continuing to seek out more intelligent ways to spend their money.

So let's go back to the sudden relevance of PaaS. I believe that we have reached a 'Perfect Storm' - where PaaS in not only considered more resilient, scalable and reliable, it has also become more mainstream.

As organisations continue to look for more cost effective ways to build their development environments, they are increasingly doing this on an as-required basis. <strong>With PaaS, companies realise they can achieve this far more easily and cost effectively whilst safe in the knowledge that they are not exposing the business to risk</strong>.

Today SaaS and the cloud are recognised as an efficient way to run your IT, and most organisations will have some or all of their technology infrastructure in this environment. So why shouldn't application development and PaaS live in the cloud as well? All things considered, it now makes perfect sense to try PaaS.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The application development market is going through radical change. Not only has technology increased tenfold in complexity, but there are also many new tools to understand. Meanwhile, constant demands from the business continue to roll in.

It's hard for most developers to keep pace with the current rate of change. IT departments are expected to continually modify applications, and the number of new projects per developer just keeps growing. This creates an accumulation of new service or change requests from the business, which puts a massive strain on resource. Many IT departments have also found that their application development tools have been woefully inadequate and unable to cope with the level of complexity and change now required.

<!--more-->

The net result is that a lot of organisations are seeking out better ways to develop new projects more quickly, flexibly and cost effectively. Many are turning to the cloud and to platform as a service (PaaS). The great news is that PaaS is now much more mature now than it was a few years ago. It's less risky and as a result, organisations are much more receptive to using it.

Don't get me wrong, adoption won't happen overnight. I doubt that we will suddenly find that everyone is putting all their application development into the cloud. Instead, I believe that trust and confidence in PaaS will be built gradually as organisations move certain aspects of their development into the cloud. <strong>PaaS gives organisations more options</strong>. For example, they may want to start a project in the cloud because <strong>it is quick and easy to fire up and they don't have to go through multiple approvals to get a project underway</strong>. Over time, they may move more and more of the development and production into the cloud or they may decide to keep a hybrid environment.

<strong>The other big benefit of PaaS is that it's easier and simpler to manage than many other environments.</strong>

Development teams can deliver massively scalable, complex applications that are simple to change and can easily integrate with their existing systems. It is a very economical option that also helps to alleviate resource pressures. You can also get developers assigned to a project much more efficiently. You are not shackled by other departments while you wait for approval. You simply turn it on as and when demand is required. With PaaS, you have a huge amount of flexibility especially if the PaaS solution is non-proprietary and you have the <strong>freedom to move from one system to the next</strong>.

I have also found that <strong>PaaS helps to reduce the friction</strong>, because application development teams can easily become the scapegoat for failed or late projects. However, by having a quick and flexible platform to turn to where new initiatives can be driven forward more easily, development teams become more receptive to the demands of the business and over time they will start to build a better relationship with other departments. PaaS can also help with internal resource challenges enabling organisations to manage more with less. Developers are also generally more motivated because they can get on and develop projects faster and consequently more inclined to innovate for the business.

PaaS is the perfect way for application developers to respond to new service and change requests from the business without breaking the bank or finding that they can't deliver in the timescales that the business wants.<strong> Today, PaaS is scalable, reliable and more mature</strong>. It's a viable service model compared to other more traditional options that application development teams have had at their disposal. No wonder PaaS is being touted as the fastest growing area in cloud computing.

		<title>Solving the Pitfalls and Inherent Complexity of Responsive Design</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A large enterprise customer recently challenged us to explore the viability of responsive design when building a mobile application for their sales team to use in the field.

It was an interesting request because it's not something we would have suggested. Our recommendation to clients had always been that application functionality should be based on use cases that make sense to the device. Responsive design, we argued, brings too much complexity and greater costs in maintenance and testing.

<!--more-->

However, when this customer explained that their existing mobile app suffered from low adoption rates and their agents preferred finding a way to use the full enterprise version online, we were determined to find a solution.
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 15px;"><strong>Could we figure out how to respond to different use cases with a single code base using responsive design?</strong></p>
People use devices and apps differently. We know this from field testing, from understanding user tasks, and from studying analytics. As it's unlikely that organizations are willing or able to implement and maintain the scale of investment needed to understand how each user is using their device particularly when several distinct user profiles are involved. This particular customer's need was to see if the OutSystems platform could break them out of the mobile application rat-race the same way it had helped them with desktop applications.

What we understood from our experience at other customers was that users get frustrated when they cannot perform the same actions in the mobile application that they can in the desktop version.

It took time and tinkering, but our "a-ha!" moment came when we discovered that the OutSystems Platform could create a set of content placeholders that implement and contain the required responsive design.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/order-management-thumb-600x446-5221.jpg"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/order-management-thumb-600x446-5221.jpg" alt="order-management.jpg" width="600" height="446" /></a>

We accomplished this by creating building blocks for more than business UI. By centralizing all the inherent complexities in what we call an eSpace, and by creating web blocks for specific UI patterns - with their own stylesheets and javascript and logic - we created a framework with an enhanced page layout and with the intelligence to react to specific device constraints. Developers can now easily and quickly develop and migrate responsive web pages without worrying about the complexity behind the responsive behavior.

The benefit of these placeholders is that they avoid some of the maintenance pitfalls of responsive behavior, and when they don't, when there is a page that doesn't adapt as it should, the combination of the platform's device querying ability and rapid change capabilities means that a maintenance team can change or replace these pages with other solutions when required.
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 15px;"><strong>An Opportunity</strong></p>
Approaching responsive design this way has a major advantage for users - the pages and patterns are the same from device to device. So if the user knows the web solution, he will recognize it in different devices. A few interactions - recovering the menu, for example - might change, but otherwise it's the same app.

Thanks to the massive automation of the OutSystems Platform, our customers are able to handle the complexities of responsive design by automatically fixing what would have broken the bank to do by hand.

In the end, we were able to create an experience that translated nicely from desktop to tablet to smartphone due to the way workflows were implemented and the adaptive ability of the layout, patterns and controls.

This pre-built web block approach shows the platform's great versatility and makes responsive design easy to use and maintain. In fact, I believe we can eventually create something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, which will simplify UI development and create a smaller learning curve for developers. Developers could then create their own "Live Style Guides" and not need to learn hundreds of CSS classes required to implement responsive design. They would only need to learn about a few web blocks and drag-and-drop them into their interfaces.

You can't avoid a pitfall any easier than that.

Have you had a responsive design nightmare that could have been avoided with automation and a component like a "Live Style Guide"?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Attending as many conferences as I do, and after hundreds of conversations regarding our platform as a service (PaaS) offering, it is clear that while there is a lot of interest in cloud computing, there is also a lot of confusion over what PaaS is and is not, and over the growing number of options for application development and delivery in the cloud.

<!--more-->

<img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 30px 0 20px 20px;" alt="paas-webinar.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/paas-webinar12.png" width="308" height="62" />That's why we're excited to <a title="Live Webinar" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/events/web/high-productivity-paas/">host a live webinar</a> on November 21st with <a title="John Rhymer" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/john_r_rymer" target="_blank">John Rymer of Forrester</a> and <a title="Don Griest" href="http://exchange.fico.com/dmc" target="_blank">Don Griest of FICO</a>. Our guest speakers will discuss what drives PaaS adoption, take the mystery out of the various platform options, discuss the tremendous efficiency gains that can be achieved using high-productivity PaaS, and reveal how FICO is using the OutSystems Platform to build and deliver a wide range of decision management applications to its client base.

Our hope is that this webinar can alleviate some confusion and add value to the PaaS conversation. Last month, InfoWorld published a piece stating that <a title="Most new IT spending will be in the cloud" href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/2016-most-new-it-spending-will-be-in-the-cloud-229660" target="_blank">by 2016 most new IT spending will be in the cloud</a>. It was just one of dozens of articles published recently that discuss the state of the PaaS market and implications for enterprise application development.

Considering the rapid growth in <a title="IT Spending Predicted" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2013/09/04/predicting-enterprise-cloud-computing-growth/" target="_blank">spending predicted</a> for this new, future state of IT, the discussion is certainly warranted, and we thought a little more context might be helpful. After all, OutSystems is a PaaS company, and under the platform as a service umbrella, there are a now a multitude of new options for application development and delivery (AD&amp;D). How do you distinguish which type of PaaS solution best fits your AD&amp;D needs? Hopefully this webinar will help demystify the market.

 <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><span>I find that typically developers fit into two camps - the more<strong> traditional developer</strong> that I have just described, or the <strong>'rock star' developer</strong>. </span><span style="line-height: 1.62;">Like many rock stars, these developers although highly intelligent, tend to be non-conformist and are sometimes difficult to manage. What differentiates them from other developers is their absolute pursuit of professionalism. These developers are totally focused on writing functional, correct, quality code. They write code that is designed well, reads well, and that expresses the intent of the author.  However, their pursuit for perfection is not always helpful for the business, which needs new projects delivered yesterday. Whilst wholly admirable, the problem is that <strong>rock star developers sometimes have a lack of focus on business requirements and can become too obsessed with delivering great technology, rather than what users actually want</strong>.<strong> Often the user experience is an afterthought once the code has been developed.</strong></span></p>
 <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><span><span>Don't get me wrong, I am a great advocate of software craftsmanship.  Developing clean code, code that works and delivers a great user experience (UX), is critical to the uptake of new applications.  From my perspective applications fail not because they are functionally poor but because they have not been adopted properly. UX can't be a late addition, it needs to be at the forefront of an organisation's development strategy. Developers need to design something that people want to use without getting frustrated and this means investing a lot more care, thought and testing into the design process and it also means producing good code.</span></span></p>
 <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><span>The good news is that I believe that we are now seeing a <strong>third type of developer starting to emerge</strong> who takes the rock star developer's passion for professionalism to the next level. This new breed, of 'change agent' developer is more business savvy, entrepreneurial and innately understands the importance of the user experience.  <strong>The 'change agent' developer takes ownership of a project and works collaboratively with the business to transform business requirements and product specifications into user benefits</strong>. Uncharacteristic to the more traditional developer, the change agent developer, actually thrives on change and brings market changing ideas to the CIOs office. Other key attributes include:</span></p>
 
 <ul>
 	<li>A more balanced set of skills that combine <strong>good communication techniques with sound business acumen</strong>, which enables effective interactions across different business functions.</li>
 	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>A</strong> <strong>business delivery attitude that is open to organisational and technological change</strong>.  Instead of fixating on why something cannot be changed they seek to find a way to accomplish the goal and what it will entail. They typically work across multiple systems, applications and platforms and understand inherently how everything needs to works together.</li>
 	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>A real passion for delivering a great user experience</strong>. This new breed of developers really cares about the user experience and as a result has a more iterative approach to new projects. They constantly conduct user tests to ensure that they have understood their needs and that the project is progressing in the right direction.</li>
 	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>A drive to deliver great applications that are designed well</strong>, read well and contain good clean code.</li>
 	<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>A proactive, questioning approach</strong> that thrives on change and challenging the status quo.</li>
 </ul>
 <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><span>Whatever type of developer you have within your organisation, the first two I described or the emerging developer, the reality is that we probably all have a mix.   However to deliver some or all of the attributes outlined above developers really need plug and play technology that enables the seamless integration of best of breed design and best of breed development. This is where OutSystems can help.  <strong>Our application development platform for delivering web and mobile applications enables developers to automate many of the processes involved. This in-turn helps to free up developers to seek out better ways to develop applications which means that any developer whichever 'type' they fit into will start to evolve and bring new thinking into the business</strong>.</span></p>
 <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><span><span>In reality this new breed of developer should and will become the norm because businesses will demand it.  I therefore believe that moving forward all developers need to adopt a business delivery attitude, they must care about the user experience and want to deliver great applications and be proud of the work they produce.  This might sound like Nirvana but with the right tools, the right attitude, appropriate support from the business and training, you will be amazed at what the application development team can accomplish.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recent research by Deloitte shows a growing reversal of the outsourcing trend. In its 2012 Global Outsourcing and Insourcing survey released <strong>in March 2013,</strong> <strong>48% of respondents said that they had terminated an outsourcing agreement early</strong>, either for cause or convenience. While the majority of those businesses subsequently chose to move their outsourcing contract to a different service provider, <strong>34% said they decided to bring the work back in-house</strong>. According to Deloitte, the three main drivers were to improve customer service, to gain greater control over functions that were previously outsourced, and ironically perhaps, to reduce costs.<!--more-->
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>So what has precipitated this shift?</strong></p>
<img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="font-size: 12.727272033691406px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;" alt="innovation-1.jpg" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Dont-Risk-Losing-Your-Ability-to-Innovate1.jpg" width="308" height="204" />

Fifteen years ago the market was very different. To start with, labour was in short supply and employment was high. It therefore made absolute sense to outsource and at the time it was pretty price competitive to do so. Today's world is very different and there are four key reasons why companies should look to in-source and take control off their IT systems, bringing this back in-house:
<ul>
	<li>Today companies need to constantly innovate in order to remain relevant</li>
	<li>Many IT services can now be automated, which reduces the requirement to outsource</li>
	<li>Speed of change is phenomenal and challenging. In this environment, it is hard for outsourcers to deliver a competitive rate that keeps paces with the demands of the business</li>
	<li>Achieving efficiencies and cost savings is difficult when you have an inflexible fixed cost, long-term, service level agreement</li>
</ul>
When a company outsources, the main problem it faces is that the internal knowledge and understanding of its products or processes naturally fades over time. As a result companies face a loss of control. Organisations quickly realise that they are completely reliant on the outsourcer who built their applications, own their code, and can charge a premium for any maintenance or enhancements that need to be made. Going back to the Deloitte report, 77% of the survey respondents indicated that <strong>a key factor for insourcing was to get that control back, particularly over the strategic direction of IT</strong>. A loss of control means that many organisations lose the ability to innovate and or be productive.

As a result<strong> businesses are now much more cautious about outsourcing and with good reasons and those that do are being far more selective about what they outsource</strong>. Many organisations are now looking to retain the people and the resources that are differentiating them in the market. This enables them to innovate and provide competitive advantage. Enlightened organisations are looking to hold onto the 'brain side' of IT and only continue to outsource commodity IT. Don't get me wrong, organisations should use external resources to fulfil their commodity IT where it makes sense. Here using the cloud for non-mission-critical functions is a good route and a very viable option.

Although it may sound counter intuitive, <strong>cost reduction was another key factor cited by 77%</strong> of survey respondents. Many stated that there was an increase in service delivery through scope 'creep' and excessive charge orders. The pace of change for organisations is now phenomenal and today technology is more complex, fast paced and challenging. Many IT departments are therefore being hit daily with either new application requests or change requests from the business. The cost/productivity benefits for an outsourcer to provide such services starts to become prohibitive and customers are finding that they need better economies of scale - particularly better cost and touch points around such projects. Additionally, in an outsourcing relationship, often costs and service levels are agreed over long-term contracts, which then make it hard to retrospectively change these to fit with new business demands.
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-top: 20px;"><strong>So what's the alternative?</strong></p>
The good news is that technology has moved on so much that many of these <strong>processes previously outsourced can now be delivered and managed internally through automation</strong>. In fact I would go as far to say that <strong>there are many cost effective and productive alternate technologies that will deliver many of the IT programmes an organisation might have previously outsourced</strong>, at a fraction of the cost. Today smart organisations are looking to automate wherever possible and they are seeking out more effective, agile and rapid ways to develop applications and bring projects to market faster. Automating processes, services and certain technology functions negates the need for the client to buy costly man-days from an IT outsourcer. This is where our <strong>high performance application development platform can really help by delivering web and mobile applications that are not only 'built for change' but create high productivity environments.</strong>

<strong>The ability to change applications quickly and easily without breaking anything is an imperative for any modern business</strong>. As is making sure you retain knowledge of your systems and processes internally so that you don't become hostage to any outsourced relationship. If you lose control around this knowledge, you risk losing the ability to innovate. As we start to move out of recession, companies that cannot innovate, will certainly hamper their growth prospects and as a result won't steal a march on their competitors. They may even be in danger of becoming irrelevant - don't let that happen to you - think carefully about what you need and whether automating various functions is a more cost effective and productive way to deliver what the business needs.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SaaS. PaaS. IaaS. aPaaS. xPaaS. BEaaS. XMaaS. Ok, so I made the last one up. But the other "as a service" acronyms are alive and well, and this is the short list!<!--more-->

By now, we are all very familiar with <strong>software as a service (SaaS)</strong> because we use it every day, whether it is <a href="http://salesforce.com/" target="_blank">salesforce.com</a> for CRM or sales force management or gmail for email and calendaring. We sign-up and go, often times without the help, intervention or even the permission of our IT departments.

Now, <strong>platform as a service ( PaaS)</strong> is about to take center stage. According to a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2013/08/20/451-research-platform-as-a-service-paas-fastest-growing-area-of-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">451 Research report</a>, PaaS is poised to be the fastest growing segment of cloud computing and will attain a 41% CAGR through 2016, generating 24% of total cloud revenues.

But what is a PaaS? According to the source of all truth ; )<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" target="_blank"> Wikipedia</a>, "platform as a service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a computing platform and a solution stack as a service. It is a service model of cloud computing where the consumer creates the software using tools and/or libraries from the provider. The consumer also controls software deployment and configuration settings. The provider provides the networks, servers, storage, and other services that are required to host the consumer's application."

If you talk to the leading industry analysts, PaaS vendors fall into two broad categories. Those where coders go to write code (just writing it in the cloud), and those that provide some high-productivity platform that is designed to make it easier to build applications quickly and by a wider variety of 'developers' (e.g. you don't have to be a Ruby or Java expert.)

"PaaS for coders" (as some call it) delivers all of the infrastructure advantages of cloud computing, but is arguably a less productive development environment, at least initially. As a developer, you still write code in the language of your choice, but also must now learn/understand how to leverage/invoke the new features/capabilities available to you in the cloud (multi-tenancy, elasticity, etc.)

<strong>High-productivity PaaS platforms hold the real promise for game-changing transformation regarding how companies can address the ever-increasing and urgent requests for innovative web and mobile business applications.</strong> Not only can you start <strong>NOW</strong>, I mean literally <strong>NOW</strong> - there is nothing to provision, no security policies to adjust, no IT hurdles to jump over - but you are leveraging a development paradigm specifically designed to get things done fast. Delivering business value in days and weeks as opposed to months or years. A good perspective of high-productivity PaaS and the ROI that can be achieved is discussed in this recent <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/events/web/high-productivity-paas/" target="_self">webcast</a> with Forrester and OutSystems partner FICO.

<strong>OutSystems is positioned squarely in the high-productivity PaaS</strong> space (or if you talk to Gartner, aPaaS, for application platform as a service). And while the space is new and emerging the already (and only) dominant player in the space is Force.com, riding off the coattails of the thousands of companies that have adopted salesforce.com. If you are a salesforce.com customer wanting to create some apps that leverage the salesforce.com data model and integrate with your salesforce.com implementation, Force.com would be an obvious consideration. The data and related business logic are already locked into the Force.com cloud, writing some more apps that leverage that data model does not make it less locked-in.

But what if you are expanding the data model? Or writing applications that integrate into systems of record other than salesforce.com. Or if you want the flexibility to leverage your Java or .NET skills Or if you need the portability that a hybrid cloud or on-prem deployment model provides? And what if you need a more sophisticated approach to staging and devops? What if you simply want choice?

The comprehensive analysis of the OutSystems Platform and Force.com includes a seven-point comparison of architecture, performance, ease of use, fitness for purpose, stability, support, and value. The paper provides enough information to help IT professionals determine which product matches their needs and requirements. And how does OutSystems fair in this comparison? Spoiler alert: Do you think I would be writing this blog or promoting the paper if we did poorly? Seriously, it is a very detailed review of the pros and cons of both platforms. If you are considering Force.com you really owe it to yourself to review this report. And we are providing it here... as a service ... to you.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HTML5 Rocks</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What kind of title is “HTML5 Rocks” for a blog post? Hopefully by the end of this post you’ll both understand and feel it as well!

First, a little history. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/introduction.html#introduction" target="_blank">W3C</a> states that:

“<em>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents.</em>”<!--more-->

This actually means that HTML was not created to target the vague subject commonly referred to as Web Applications.

The 5th major version of HTML (aka HTML5) introduces new features, ranging from CSS3 (related technology) to GeoLocation and WebStorage that mainly target Web Applications. HTML5 is not one big thing but a collection of individual features. This actually means two things:
<ol>
	<li>HTML5 support can’t be detected and instead we must detect if the specific feature that we want to use is supported by the browser (feature detection).</li>
	<li>HTML5 specification is not closed. More and more features are being included in the W3C recommendation.</li>
</ol>
The image below gives a small idea of what might be added in the near future.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1661" alt="html5-pic1" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/html5-pic1.png" width="567" height="384" />

But from all these cool, and perhaps cryptic, features, there are a couple that we should try to incorporate into our applications without hesitation.

So, is HTML5 introducing new tags? Not entirely true. If you still think of HTML as only tags and angle brackets, you’re missing an important part. For example, HTML5 doesn’t just define the &lt;video&gt; tag, but also the corresponding API. With this API, it’s possible to detect support for video format, stop, play, pause or even to know how much of the video has been downloaded.

You might be thinking, “I build enterprise applications, so those features don’t really fit in!” Well, that couldn’t be further from the truth. In our fast-paced world, not being available in mobile is almost like not existing. So, when adapting or creating web applications, we must consider that users might not be where we think they are (e.g. office desk).

With this in mind, we can create better applications (see <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2013/11/solving-the-pitfalls-and-complexity-of-responsive-design.html">Solving the Pitfalls and Inherent Complexity of Responsive Design</a>) by adding features to the application that will further help the user performing the tasks.

&nbsp;

<strong>So, what are the <span style="color: #000080;">Top 5 features</span> of HTML5 that we should be using now?</strong>
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1. GeoLocation</strong></span></h4>
<strong>This feature obtains the geographical position of a device. Imagine:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Showing information based on the user’s location.</li>
	<li>Mapping the day’s route for your salespeople.</li>
	<li>Giving delivery drivers specific directions based on their location (A):</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1694" alt="map" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/map.png" width="316" height="218" /></p>
All of this is possible if the location of the user is known. However, because this information can compromise user privacy, the position is only available if the user approves it - this permission is requested at a domain level:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1662" alt="pic2" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic2.png" width="535" height="41" /></p>
If the device being used doesn’t have GPS, the system will try to provide a location based on the IP address. This, as one might imagine, will decrease it’s accuracy.

<strong>Now the techie stuff!</strong>

To use this feature, the following method should be called:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1663" alt="pic3" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic3.png" width="389" height="37" /></p>
This method can receive<strong> three parameters</strong>:

I. <strong>Success</strong>: This is a callback function that will be called as soon as the position is obtained. This parameter is mandatory.
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1664" alt="pic4" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic4.png" width="322" height="113" /></p>
This callback function receives a JSON object containing the information obtained:
<ul>
	<li>Timestamp</li>
	<li>Speed</li>
	<li>Heading</li>
	<li>Altitude</li>
	<li>Altitude Accuracy</li>
	<li>Latitude</li>
	<li>Longitude</li>
	<li>Accuracy</li>
</ul>
II. <strong>Error</strong>: This is a callback function that will be called if an error is received when obtaining the position.
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1665" alt="pic5" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic5.png" width="230" height="115" /></p>
If the user refused to shared their location, this method will be called stating.

III. <strong>Options</strong>: This parameter receives a JSON object with the possible configurations that the API may receive:
<ul>
	<li>enableHighAccuracy:</li>
	<li>timeout</li>
	<li>maximumAge</li>
</ul>
To learn more about this API, please see the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html" target="_blank">W3C specification</a>.

&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2. Camera access</strong></span></h4>
<strong>The HTML5 provides the ability to access the media devices presented on the mobile devices: camera (picture/video), microphone, etc.</strong>

To use this feature it’s only required to add some attributes to the upload file tag:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1666" alt="pic6" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic6.png" width="297" height="42" /></p>
In order to use this feature in the OutSystems Platform, just use the upload file widget and add the above tags to the extended properties:

<img class="size-full wp-image-1667 alignnone" alt="pic7" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic7.png" width="344" height="254" />

&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>3. Canvas</strong></span></h4>
<strong>The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. This means that to do something like this:</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1668" alt="pic8" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic8.png" width="104" height="103" /></p>
The following HTML tag is added first:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1669" alt="pic9" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic9.png" width="295" height="53" /></p>
Then using JavaScript, elements can be drawn in it:

<img class="size-full wp-image-1670 alignnone" alt="pic10" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic10.png" width="241" height="89" />

But how could the Canvas element be helpful anyhow? Well, to allow the following sort of things:

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-1705" alt="IMG_22012014_103950" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_22012014_103950.png" width="521" />

Yes, it’s possible using the canvas to collect the user's signature! (Tablet, Smartphone, etc.)

&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong style="font-size: 1em;">4. Web storage</strong></span></h4>
<strong>With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user's browser. Earlier, this was done with cookies. However, web storage is more secure and faster.</strong>

Persistent local storage is one area where native client applications have held an advantage over web applications. For native applications, the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state.

Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after a user navigates away from the web site, closes a browser tab, or exits a browser, etc. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless sent manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

This is one of those features that is still very volatile. Be sure to read the specs and then check if your target browsers support it.

&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>5. App cache</strong></span></h4>
<strong>The cache manifest in HTML5 is a software storage feature which provides the ability to access a web application even without a network connection.</strong>

As is well described in <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/offline.html" target="_blank">Dive Into HTML5</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“At its simplest, an offline web application is a list of URLs - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, or any other kind of resource. The home page of the offline web application points to this list, called a manifest file, which is just a text file located elsewhere on the web server. A web browser that implements HTML5 offline applications will read the list of URLs from the manifest file, download the resources, cache them locally, and automatically keep the local copies up to date as they change. When the time comes that you try to access the web application without a network connection, your web browser will automatically switch over to the local copies instead.”</em></p>
This means the pages are stored statically in the browser (submit buttons won’t work) and forms will have to be handled manually using Web Storage, for example.

In order to use this feature, one has to add a tag manifest to the HTML element:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1672" alt="pic12" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic12.png" width="234" height="59" /></p>
This means that the browser will understand that there is cache manifest file that needs to be downloaded. The browser now knows that the following page, plus others, might need to be cached.

Then the cache manifest file contains several sections:
<ul>
	<li>Cache: This section will indicate which files (images, css, JS, web pages) should be stored locally.</li>
	<li>Network: This section indicates the resources that require the user to be online.</li>
	<li>Fallback: This section indicates which resources should be served to the user if trying to access them while offline.</li>
</ul>
So, typically the cache manifest looks as follows:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1673" alt="pic13" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pic13.png" width="444" height="262" /></p>
If using the web storage feature or the cache manifest, first try looking into the following OutSystems Forge component, which will help achieve both:

<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/479/html5offline/" target="_blank">http://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/479/html5offline/</a>

Finally, remember that HTML5 is here to stay. Here is what the W3C had to say about the future of web standards in July 2009:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Today the Director announces that when the XHTML 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the HTML Working Group, W3C hopes to accelerate the progress of HTML5 and clarify W3C’s position regarding the future of HTML.”</em></p>
Although we (developers) would love to trash all of the old browsers, unfortunately, we can’t. So, if you want to know that a specific feature can be used in a specific browser look at these sites: <a href="http://www.caniuse.com" target="_blank">www.caniuse.com</a> or <a href="http://html5please.com/" target="_blank">http://html5please.com/</a>.

		<title>Under Investment in Banks is Causing Major IT Headaches</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A number of recent articles put the spotlight on the latest computer glitches that resulted in down time on Cyber Monday. One can reasonably conclude that banks could stand to invest more in their IT systems to increase their ability to deliver good customer service and further protect customer data from attacks. In fact, RBS’s new chief executive Ross McEwan <a href="http://www.rbs.com/news/2013/12/ceo-ross-mcewan-statement-on-systems-outage.html" target="_blank">admitted to the press</a> that the state-run bank had under invested in IT for decades. <!--more-->He made the claim while apologising for the ‘unacceptable’ technology crash that affected one million RBS customers on Cyber Monday. He also pledged to outline plans in 2014 to ‘invest in the future’ and make RBS the bank ‘customers and Britain needs it to be.’

Clearly there is <strong>growing pressure on banks to overhaul their IT systems</strong>. As banks look to put new technology initiatives in place to better run their systems, they also have pressure to ensure that these new projects get to market quickly as the added reputational damage of another technology glitch would be tough for any bank to bear.

The Cyber Monday event surprised me. The barriers to entry are relatively low and many global banks are getting ahead with much more advanced digital strategies, yet many banks are clearly lagging behind. Enabling customers to pay and transact online, using mobile devices is fundamental to the future of banking. Banks need to be thinking about how payments will be made in the forthcoming years. For example, today there are mobile apps that can scan-in cheques, new digital currency technologies such as Bitcoins, and many new and advanced ways to pay. Will UK banks lose out because their technology is poor and customers either get left behind or disenchanted with the service and through frustration move on to another provider?

Banks need to consider how such glitches and the resulting publicity impact customer loyalty. Spikes in business, such as that experienced on Cyber Monday, must have been expected. Surely the banks should have been better prepared. Recent published figures show that retailers generated 15 times more revenue on Cyber Monday than they did on 1st November. When such spikes are inevitable, banks need to consider ways to scale out their systems. Building an on-premises architecture optimised for such spikes in business however is prohibitively expensive. The most cost-effective way to have the ability to scale up when sales are up is to take applications out to the public cloud. Using the cloud is a great way to handle those peaks in business without having to invest in hefty infrastructure costs. Then when the spike drops, banks can bring it all back in-house.

Generally, when looking to update development environments, building in agility is key. One of the ways to reduce time to market is to have an agile development environment where changes can be made more easily without causing huge delays. Whether banks are implementing new products and procedures or other new processes and services, they will need to create efficiencies in their software development processes whilst mitigating the risk of delays, rework, and spiralling costs, which can slow the time to market of applications.

In my experience, IT departments in big enterprise organisations, like banks, still get far too bogged down in management and maintenance, which leaves very little scope for new projects and innovation. In fact, according to Gartner, at least 80% of the IT budget is still spent on maintenance. I believe that IT has the ability to deliver the secure, modern IT infrastructure that clearly RBS and other banks need in order to delight customers. IT departments however need to focus on creating a more agile environment and it must look at the role that advanced technology solutions can play – all of which can help to release IT from its technology shackles.

In 2014 and beyond banks must build an environment that has the ability to adapt to business change quickly and can handle peak times better. However, often IT doesn’t have the manpower or the resource to achieve this on its own. This is where OutSystems can help. We deliver applications that are built to change at the speed of business. We help to simplify application management and development enabling hundreds of enterprise companies to rapidly deliver complex and highly scalable enterprise web and mobile applications. So, not only can we help improve IT productivity and responsiveness, with the OutSystems Platform we can enable you to deliver more innovative, modern applications that support the drive to bring banks into the 21st century.

This latest incident saw RBS’ shares fall 12 percent overnight. No business can afford to let that happen – state or private-owned. The pressure is on now for UK banks to find ways to sort this out quick.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Reasons PaaS Will Explode in 2014</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The adoption of platform as a service (PaaS) has increased dramatically over the past 12 months, and is now one of the fastest growing areas of all cloud computing services. By 2016, Gartner estimates that every organization will run some or all of its business software on public or private PaaS, driving spending up to $2.9 billion. IDC puts 2017 spending at more than $14 billion. Whatever analyst statistics are used to gauge the growth and uptake of PaaS, there is no doubt that adoption is set to significantly increase in 2014. Why?<!--more-->

Done well, this type of approach allows IT organizations to embrace blinding speed and efficiency in how they design, develop, deploy, and manage their application portfolio. Add in a maturing market and you can start to see why organizations are seeking out PaaS options.

It is well documented that PaaS offerings facilitate the deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software stacks. However, the real benefits extend way beyond the low initial start-up costs as PaaS can really enhance the overall development process. Here are five ways that PaaS does this:
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>1. Faster access to infrastructure</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">In a non-PaaS environment, the time to provision machines can sometimes take up to three months, which delays ROI and kills business agility. PaaS is the fastest way to build and deploy enterprise applications, enabling organizations to gets results in days, supercharging the application development environment.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>2. Greater scalability</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Sometimes physical scalability (compute, storage, memory) and logical scalability (load balancers, databases, middleware, front-end) are difficult to provision in a traditional datacenter set up. PaaS automates and accelerates this process to enable real elasticity and scalability.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>3. Faster time to release and iterate</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Automating the activities outside of design and development yields can significantly speed up software release cycles. This, coupled with reducing developer cycle time from requirement to release, is a powerful productivity multiplier. PaaS solutions remove otherwise oppressive but common concerns like versioning, multi-stage promotion, feedback capture, and performance instrumentation. This enables developers, IT, and business users to collaborate and iterate with impressive quality and speed.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>4. Higher availability</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Cloud enables developers to easily create solutions with high availability, which are typically difficult to provision and design on-premises. PaaS is also the perfect way for application developers to respond to new service and change requests from the business without breaking the bank.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>5. Faster time to value</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">With reliable automation and abstraction built into many PaaS solutions, IT staff members are released from time-consuming tasks allowing them to focus on high-value activities. Developers, unencumbered by the tasks they weren’t happy doing, are more motivated, creative and fast. Business users, now thrilled with newfound agility, are happier and more engaged with the process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Different PaaS offerings will be better suited to different enterprise requirements. Therefore, before going down the PaaS route, organizations really need to understand what is driving them to the cloud; otherwise the benefits realized might not meet expectations.</p>
<img class="alignright  wp-image-1748" alt="PaaS" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PaaSthumb.png" width="200" />

That said, there is no doubt that it makes more and more sense for enterprises to investigate the advantages of using PaaS in 2014.

<span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="color: #333333;">If you want to find out more about how PaaS can benefit your organization, you can get a complimentary copy of our new whitepaper, PaaS: <a title="Powering Business IT" href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/paas/powering-business-it/">Powering a New Era of Business IT</a>, and see how your business can adopt PaaS and what key considerations to take into account before going down this path.</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The retail sector was hit hard by the recession. High-profile struggles of longstanding fixtures such as Blockbuster shook the industry as many retailers worked to stay afloat.

The retail industry tends to be the bellwether for the economy as it highlights consumer confidence and today there are signs of cautious optimism.<!--more--> According to the latest figures from the <a title="BRC" href="http://www.brc.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Retail Consortium</a> (BRC), UK retail sales were up 0.4% in December 2013 on a like-for-like basis from December 2012, when they had increased 0.3% on the preceding year. On a total basis, sales were up 1.8% in December 2013 against a 1.5% increase in December 2012.

That said,<strong> retailers continue to face significant challenges</strong>.<strong> Competition remains fierce and loyalty is low</strong>. Consumers are demanding and fickle. They want their purchases to be fulfilled instantly, and if they don’t get what they want, they will quickly move on to another supplier. If retailers are unable to adapt, they will become irrelevant or fail altogether.

Continued innovation will be key to meet retail business goals and satisfy changing consumer buying patterns. IT plays a pivotal role in helping retailers engage with customers, partners and suppliers - delivering seamless multi-channel experiences, improving business efficiency and product fulfilment, and so much more.<strong> IT departments however are struggling to keep up with the pace of change demanded within the retail environment, which is affecting retailers’ ability to innovate</strong>.

In order to remain relevant to today’s consumer-driven world, retailers need to be nimble enough to outmanoeuvre the competition, and this means retail IT departments have to change the way they operate. Faced with current constraints, retailers need to move toward adaptive software development systems that can be changed quickly according to business needs. Traditional hand-coded application development platforms are no longer the fastest way to develop applications. <strong>Retailers need to investigate other approaches and platforms in order to make the application development environment more productive</strong>.

At OutSystems, we have worked with a number of retailers over the years helping to innovate in a variety of ways across their business. With the OutSystems Platform, we have helped retailers deliver amazing web and mobile applications, achieve complex integration, and create highly flexible and adaptive environments. We help retailers overcome innovation challenges and effectively outmanoeuvre the competition by taking a different approach to application development. This includes helping IT departments automate where they can and seeking out more intelligent and effective ways to develop applications.

One customer, a supermarket retailer in the Netherlands known for its excellent customer service, used the OutSystems Platform to build an application that made stock information from the website and from the shop system available to employees on the shop floor. Accurate stock intelligence now helps guide shelving decisions and enables employees to respond quickly to customer requests. Employees also have visibility into future order information so they can let customers know when stock will be back in the stores. As a result, new levels of customer service and loyalty have been achieved.

Another customer, a top 100 retailer worldwide, used the OutSystems Platform to implement a new differentiation strategy that seamlessly knit together its own production of goods with white label products and branded goods. The most recent element of this strategy was to implement a new product development and quality control solution that delivers more competitive pricing and attractive margins by enabling more control over the supply chain. As a result of this new adaptive system, the retailer now has full control from product design, contract negotiation and quality control. In addition, the retailer has been able to negotiate better prices with its suppliers. The combination of lower shipping costs and better alignment of its offerings to market demand has helped to significantly improve the retailer’s margins.

Employing a more strategic approach to development helps retailers to better manage their application stack and development requests. This includes improved segmentation and prioritisation of their application portfolio so that they are better equipped to deal with the speed of change. In fact, our retail customers claim that the OutSystems Platform has enabled them to deliver solutions with aggressive deadlines that would be impossible to achieve using traditional technologies.

Top retailers are no longer relying on yesterday’s tools and approaches to solve today’s business challenges. Instead, they are using agile development environments to control the cost of change, increase productivity and enable their businesses to innovate faster. Are you?

		<title>The Changing Role of CIOs</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2014/03/the-changing-role-of-cios.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read a recent analyst report from Forrester which outlined its view on the role that CIOs now fulfil. According to the Forrester report, <strong>CIOs are now viewed as the most important senior leaders in driving business transformation and innovation</strong>, with many believing them to have more input than a CEO. Forrester highlights the CIOs key role in supporting business change with technology playing a key part in breaking down barriers within an organisation’s structure. <!--more-->This view is backed by a survey of respondents from the US and Europe involved in business transformation projects in the last three years. The survey revealed that 29 percent of respondents believed that the CIO was the most important figure in terms of supporting and driving business change. This was the highest amongst the C-suite, and more than that of the CEO, which was seen as most important by 24 percent of respondents.

The report also identified four main types of CIO in terms of their involvement in IT projects and their ability to lead change:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Soldiers or Order-Takers</strong> - These CIOs do not have the ear of the board in the way that other CIOs often do. According to Forrester, they account for roughly 10 percent of CIOs and should, at a minimum, make sure that the business leaders are aware of the potential pitfalls of an IT project.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Leaders of IT</strong> - This group successfully balances IT and enterprise business needs and are capable of ensuring that the appropriate IT functions are involved in a large scale IT project, as well as providing a wider enterprise focus. Leaders of IT account for the majority of CIOs, approximately 70 percent.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Change Consultant</strong>s - According to Forrester, around one in 10 CIOs have extensive experience in advising and consulting on business transformation having been involved in projects in the past and are able to implement templates, best practices and learning from other companies.</li>
	<li style="padding-top: 5px;"> <strong>Transformation Leaders</strong> – This group is given the responsibility to lead the transformation themselves. They ensure effective resource application, funding and progress tracking, and they report directly to the CEO. According to Forrester, this CIO role is relatively uncommon and accounts for around 5-10% of CIOs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-top: 15px;"><strong>The role of the CIO has changed dramatically in the last decade.</strong></p>
Technology now forms the backbone of most businesses and is a major enabler of change, innovation and a driver for sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, it’s no surprise to discover that IT has become a key component of organisational planning and strategy. As such, today’s CIOs need well developed business and leadership skills, in addition to their more traditional technical abilities, in order to operate successfully at this level.

<strong>Many CIOs are becoming business leaders</strong> – but not all are moving in this direction. In my experience this is often down to the individual. For example, I recently met a CIO at a trade show who felt that his role was to tell the business why out of 10 things that the business had requested, IT could only deliver two and that his department wasn’t responsible for leading on innovation. This reinforced in my mind that despite the job title, many CIOs are still largely IT managers at heart and don’t fully understand what it takes to lead, shape and deliver a large IT project. Don’t get me wrong there are CIOs who have a keen understanding of the business and approach technology from a business driven perspective, and there are those that are born and bred technologists.

I believe that the magnitude and complexity of responsibility has also increased. Time was when the IT leadership was just about implementing technology and delivering IT projects to time and budget. Clearly these things remain important but they are now hygiene factors. <strong>What really matters for the new generation of CIOs is delivering value to the business</strong>, whether this comes from the way in which they support the day-to-day operations, ensuring that business and IT strategies are aligned or by helping to deliver IT enabled business change.

As for those CIOs who fall into the category of ‘born and bred technologist’ – they must evolve or they will become irrelevant. They must develop a keen understanding of the business, be effective at collaborating with different business teams and understand the importance of any IT project they are leading. In order to achieve this they need a balanced set of skills that combines good communication techniques with sound business acumen, enabling effective interactions across different business functions. <strong>They must be innovators, agile, strategic thinkers that embrace new technologies and new ways of approaching old problems</strong>. Today, businesses change at the speed of light and CIOs need to have the capability to <strong>quickly change direction to keep pace with business requests</strong>. Above all, I believe they need to have a proactive, questioning approach that thrives on challenging the status quo.

However, to deliver some or all of the attributes outlined above, CIOs really need to be supported by agile, flexible, ‘plug and play’ technology that enables them to rapidly deliver what the business needs. They need agile and adaptive systems, not clunky hard-coded applications, to give them the freedom to innovate and more importantly help their teams be more productive and explore new possibilities, bringing fresh thinking to the organisation.

<strong>So back to my opening paragraph and question: are CIOs becoming more pivotal to the business than CEOs?</strong>

I believe this is changing with CIOs increasingly maturing into true business leaders. As they develop their skill sets, garner business experience in the wider organisation rather than just in IT, and function more entrepreneurially (whilst retaining a ruthless focus on good business practice), then I think we’ll see a new breed of CIO that is well equipped to lead and deliver change and innovation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>OutSystems Platform 2014 Winter Release</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2014/03/outsystems-platform-2014-winter-release.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To celebrate Valentine’s Day, we launched a series of updates to the OutSystems Platform. I guess that for a lot of you, this is one of those gifts you’ll be excited to use all year around.

There are so many mind-blowing improvements that we’re even a bit ashamed of naming it 8.0.1. There’s a great reason for that though: it works just as a patch release… our cloud users will start seeing their platform get updated with the new capabilities and our on-premises or hybrid customers can simply patch their installation and immediately benefit from all that is in there.
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">So, what can you expect from this release?<!--more--></p>

<h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><span style="color: #333399;">Great User Experiences Across All Devices</span></h4>
<h5><strong>A new, responsive-ready, web page editor</strong></h5>
This release includes a brand new web editor with full support for responsive design, providing even higher-fidelity previews of the application being built without ever having to leave OutSystems.

Written from scratch for performance and to take advantage of the WebKit browser engine, the new web editor gives a pixel-perfect preview of HTML5 and CSS3 while editing, making the whole design experience much faster.

Grid layouts are an awesome way to ensure design consistency and to accelerate screen design by making it easier to layout content. In this version, support for responsive grids is included as applications are designed, making it super-easy to build your screen layout for the desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1792"><img class=" wp-image-1792 alignnone" alt="1" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.png" width="545" height="322" /></a>
<h5><strong>Responsive by default</strong></h5>
A new responsive theme that is flat, responsive and touch ready is now included as the default for new applications. The London theme bundles everything needed to discover the best way to build an application that works across devices.

Much more than a set of styles and layouts that can be used throughout your application, this theme is a complete style guide that helps with many of the composition patterns needed in applications. It includes templates that can be reused such as Dashboards, Long forms, Wizards, Infinite scrolls, Advanced search, Editable lists, Tabs, Breadcrumbs, Cards, etc...

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/london-theme.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1793"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1793" alt="london-theme" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/london-theme.png" width="600" height="320" /></a>

The London theme was built with customization in mind, and it’s very easy to transform it to your company’s look. By going to the theme landing page <a title="London Theme" href="http://labs.outsystems.net/LondonTheme" target="_blank">(http://labs.outsystems.net/LondonTheme</a>) and writing your company’s web address in the customization section, the theme is personalized just for you - including colors and company logo.

And because the theme is all standard CSS3, it can be further customized for your specific needs. This is not only a great accelerator, but also an awesome way to learn the best way to extend a theme, and even understand, by inspection, how to create your own theme and share it with the community.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/london-theme-2.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1794"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1794" alt="london-theme-2" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/london-theme-2.png" width="600" height="320" /></a>
<h5><strong>Icons, icons, icons</strong></h5>
<img class=" wp-image-1796 alignright" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="mobile-icons" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mobile-icons.png" width="250" height="207" />

Every application needs some color. And icons are a great way to represent a particular action on an application, with a visual queue that users will recognize as they get used to the application.

To get started without having to hire a design team, we’ve bundled a set of beautifully designed, highly usable icons (based on AwesomeFont) and made it really easy to include them in any application.

These icons adapt well to any size and can be highly customized to almost any need. And they’re amazingly simple to use, just by drag and drop, browse, and customize.
<h5><strong>Device testing made easy</strong></h5>
It would be great if only a single device needed to be considered. But the fact of the matter is that with the proliferation of new devices appearing, each one with its own form factor, it is harder to ensure your user base will own the device you expect. Applications need to account for this.

Responsive design is a great approach to cover these needs with minimum impact to productivity, but it also implies that you need to test your applications across this wide range of form factors. To help accomplish this task, the OutSystems Platform 8 introduced an extremely simple way to test applications with different form factors. As an application is published and opened in the browser, you’re immediately redirected to a screen that let’s you choose which form factor to test in (with the usual standards bundled in). You can fine tune the form factor in which the application will be tested or immediately open it in a mobile device by scanning a QR code.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-1797" alt="mobile-theme" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mobile-theme.png" width="600" height="380" />
<h5><strong>A new 100% smartphone theme</strong></h5>
Smartphones present unique challenges in terms of application design and sometimes responsive is not enough. For those scenarios, you now have access to the new LondonMobile - a 100% smartphone theme. This theme takes advantage of advanced HTML5 and JavaScript optimizations making the entire smartphone experience more fluid, without having to know them. It also includes new smartphone-specific widgets (e.g. scroll to show more, right aligned menu for a more usable experience, toggles for checkboxes, …) making your applications a pleasure to use on small form factors.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smartphone-theme.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1798"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1798" alt="smartphone-theme" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smartphone-theme.png" width="600" height="401" /></a>
<h5><strong>A bunch of usability and productivity improvements</strong></h5>
<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Smart suggestions</strong></span>

<img class=" wp-image-1801 alignright" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="ux-improvements" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ux-improvements.png" width="200" height="228" />

Whenever a value needs to be set in OutSystems, a list of suggested values is always provided to make your job easier. In version 8.0.1 we’ve made these suggestions even smarter, to better predict what is needed at each step of development.

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Assign node usability</strong></span>

Applications in the OutSystems Platform handle huge sets of data going back and forth, in and out. Mapping transformations of this data is not always easy. To further help, we’ve improved the usability of the Assign node, so it is much easier to understand what each assign consists of.

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Links around containers or web blocks</strong></span>

Did you ever want to make an entire area or section clickable?

<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1802 alignleft" style="padding-right: 20px;" alt="web-blocks" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/web-blocks-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" />

Do you need large and rich touch areas in applications? Do you want to package rich, UI complex and reusable blocks that your team can reuse as buttons or links across applications?
If the answer to any of these is yes, you’ll be happy to know that in this version any of these elements can be included inside a link widget, giving much more freedom when composing web applications. The use cases are so broad and powerful that we wanted to make sure this new “minor improvement” didn’t go unnoticed.

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Richer mobile list screens</strong></span>

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mobile-screens.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1803"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1803" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="mobile-screens" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mobile-screens-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a><strong></strong>

When scaffolding a new mobile list screen, the default list is now created with a List Records (instead of the previous Table Records). This allows for richer list elements with much less work. Combined with the ability to have web blocks inside links, this allows you to design in detail the content of each one of your mobile list rows, fine tune it, make it reusable, and just drag it to be your list element. Not only is maintainability improved, you’ll be much more focused on improving the user experience of your mobile app.

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Improved widget navigation</strong></span>

To build a truly great application, a great UI is needed. We realize that developers spend a lot of time tweaking web and mobile screens, and in this version, we have improved how you select, move, and navigate widgets inside a screen. Understanding and navigating the hierarchy of widgets, while still maintaining the real preview, is now much more easily done just by clicking on the widget name right in the editor. And when you need to tweak the data source for your list or table, it is easily accessible right from the user interface.

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Themes layout inheritance</strong></span>

<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1805" style="padding-left: 20px;" alt="improved-navigation" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/improved-navigation-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" />
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">In order to increase maintainability of your application and provide you better options when redesigning an application, both grids and layout web blocks settings on a theme are inherited. The outcome of this is that the actual layouts (Masterpages) used on a screen, are defined by the theme itself, instead of on a particular screen. By changing the applied theme, all the pages using that theme will see its layout updated.</p>

<h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><span style="color: #333399;">Major Performance Improvements in 1-Click Publishing and Staging</span></h4>
The day-to-day of an OutSystems developer is spent making heavy changes on critical applications, over and over. The 1-Click Publish operation is a core part of this process, and one that is done dozens or hundreds of times per day.

Whenever you need to see the effect of changes to an application, be it UI, business logic, data model or integrations, the Outsystems Platform lets you do that with just one click. Getting your changes done in the model, uploaded as a new version in the version control system, getting highly optimized Java or C# code out of it, and then getting it compiled and deployed to the cloud or across your on-premises server farm is a heavy lifting job. Sure enough, having it automated is a big help.

Such a critical piece requires constant tuning for increased reliance and performance. On this version, we’ve taken a giant leap and introduced a huge increase in performance, not only in the 1-Click Publish process, but in a lot of the capabilities that rely on it’s technology.

In this version, we’ve refactored the most lengthy part of the process (transforming / generating the model into highly performant code), achieving optimizations that decrease the time required for the entire 1-Click Publish process. This part of the process had an average performance improvement of 86%.
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, going from application change to application running is now up to 60% faster!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1806 aligncenter" alt="before-now" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/before-now.png" width="333" height="171" /></p>
These improvements will be noticed on every operation that implies generating code out of your model. As such a similar level of overall improvements in the following operations can be expected:
<ul>
	<li>Publishing an application for the first time</li>
	<li>Making a change to an existing application</li>
	<li>Publishing existing modules, solutions or solution versions</li>
	<li>Staging applications between environments</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Immediate test query</strong></h5>
Along with these improvements in code generation, we’ve refactored one of the most important actions that, as a developer, you use every day. Testing a query, to check if you’re doing everything right, debugging it or fine tune it against example data or different conditions before actually deploying the new version is done over and over again when you’re developing. This operation usually took around 14 seconds.
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Now it is immediate! Only depending on the ability of your database to handle it, of course.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #333399; padding-top: 30px;">Want It? Go Grab It!</span></h4>
Overall, these changes represent a huge productivity increase in daily work, allow you to test more often on all devices, and make the operation of staging an application to production even leaner.

Just head over to <a title="OutSystems Download" href="http://www.outsystems.com/home/downloads/">http://www.outsystems.com/home/downloads/</a> and get it installed on your private cloud, or ping back OutSystems to know when it will be available on your cloud subscription, if not already there!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The process of continuous iteration as an OutSystems developer requires quick change and test cycles. The 1-Click Publish (1CP) operation is a core part of this process, and one that is used dozens or hundreds of times per day.

Whenever you need to see the effect of changes you have done to an application, be it UI, Business Logic, Data Models, Processes, or Integrations, the OutSystems Platform lets you do that with just one click. <!--more-->Getting from your changes done in the model, to a fully deployed application in the cloud or across your on-premises server farm is a heavy lifting job - so having this all automated is a big help.

This critical part of our technology receives constant tuning to increase reliance and performance. However, in version 8.0.1 we’ve taken a leap that introduces a huge increase in performance - not only for the 1-Click Publish process, but also for a lot of the capabilities that rely on it.
<h4 style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Main stages of 1CP process</h4>
As you might have noticed, when publishing an application, the 1CP process is composed of 3 main steps: Upload, Compile, and Deploy.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1-click-publish.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1834"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1834" alt="1-click-publish" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1-click-publish.png" width="564" height="110" /></a>
<h5>Stage 1: Upload</h5>
Uploading begins by checking the differences between the version of an application you want to upload and the version of the application already published.If conflicts are found, the Platform allows you to visually merge them, ensuring a continuously integrated environment that is always running the latest code. Next, all references to other modules and extensions are validated and can be refreshed if not up to date. This ensures that updated and consistent versions of all dependencies are being used. Finally, your latest module is uploaded as the new version in the version control system - critical if you ever need to rollback to a previous version.
<h5>Stage 2: Compile</h5>
Compiling loads the new version of your module from the version control system to memory, performs some static analysis over the model to determine possible optimizations, and uses the OutSystems compiler to generate performant Java or C# code, as well as all the database migration/update scripts required to bring your application up to date. Next, the appropriate Java or C# native compiler is called to compile the generated code and obtain the binary files that will be included in your web application.
<h5>Stage 3: Deploy</h5>
This is the final step of the 1CP process, and it is responsible for copying the files generated in the previous step to the front-end servers, updating the database model to reflect your changes, and finally deploying your web application to the application server.
<h4 style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px;">1CP performance improvements</h4>
We constantly gather feedback from our customers, and what they told us was that even though the 1CP process is a huge help in their develop and test cycles, they felt their productivity could be improved further. Applications change at such a high rate, that developers use the 1CP operation several dozen times a day.

Increasing productivity was something that would benefit the entire developer community. So, deciding to dig deeper, we set out to identify how we could push the performance of this process to an even higher level.

To make sure we were working towards the right solution, we needed to know everything about the problem. We began collecting metrics about the 1CP process in real usage scenarios. By using this data, we were able to make informed decisions about which stages of the process should be optimized first. This ensured that whatever we optimized could be measured against the previous state and have a real impact for our users.
<h5>The real insight</h5>
What we found as a result of our analysis was that even with multiple optimizations already in place, it was the second stage of the 1CP process that took the greatest amount of time to complete. If we were to make any increase in productivity, it would have to happen during compiling.
<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/real-insight.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1835"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" alt="real-insight" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/real-insight.png" width="316" height="180" /></a>

To ensure that 1CP processes don’t interfere with one another, the code generation step was running in complete isolation, which means that no data was shared between different 1CPs. This level of isolation was the reason compiling took as long as it did.

While isolation is important, compiling in between 1CPs required reloading a lot of data and dependencies not directly linked to the 1CP.

In the tradeoff between isolation and performance, we decided to keep the isolation where it mattered to keep the 1CP process robust, but to increase performance by sharing things like database connections and platform settings across different processes.

In version 8.0.1 we’ve refactored the OutSystems compiler to greatly reduce the amount of time required to generate code, achieving optimizations that have a great impact on the entire 1-click publish process. <strong>Now, going from application change to application running is up to 60% faster!</strong>

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/real-insight2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1836"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1836" alt="real-insight2" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/real-insight2.png" width="428" height="178" /></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>What does this mean to you? Well, a few statistics from our research:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>An OutSystems developer publishes 33 times per day on average</li>
	<li>The average 1CP took 95 seconds</li>
	<li>This means that one developer spent an average of 45 mins per day publishing</li>
	<li>Sixty percent performance gain here gives you almost 30 minutes back in your day</li>
	<li>For organizations, it means that for every 5 developers you get an entire day back every week!</li>
</ul>
We will continue to push efficiency in every part of the Platform to bring you more time to enjoy the art of developing and innovating. Have a suggestion? We would love to hear from you. See you in the comments…]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, OutSystems was selected as a finalist for the prestigious <a title="CODiE" href="http://www.siia.net/codies/2014/finalists.asp" target="_blank">2014 SIIA CODiE Awards</a>. We placed in its <strong>Best Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> category along with several other firms, including Red Hat and NetSuite.<!--more-->
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/codie-2014.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1878"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1878" style="padding: 20px;" alt="codie-2014" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/codie-2014.png" width="316" height="36" /></a>We’re honored by this nomination and recognition. A tremendous amount of effort and ingenuity has gone into developing OutSystems Platform. Our team is among the most dedicated in the PaaS market today, working with and listening to our 350+ enterprise customers so we can continually deliver something truly remarkable - a solution that empowers them to create, deploy and manage limitless mobile and web applications without traditional friction points such as infrastructure or hand-coding. The Platform is available in the cloud, on-premises, or as a hybrid environment.</p>
<strong>But in a crowded market with multiple vendors selling wildly different solutions, what sets us apart?</strong>

Well for starters, instead of simply moving hand-coding to the cloud, with OutSystems, businesses can strap a rocket to the productivity of their application efforts. <strong>How?</strong> By using a visual design and development metaphor to create simple to complex applications that are as easy to make and release as they are to modify, giving them the freedom to innovate and break the shackles of inescapable change backlogs.

We do all of this while protecting customers from lock-in, meaning that at any point they can detach from OutSystems and take their Platform-generated standard Java or .NET applications and run them on unaltered stacks.

The finalists in our category have powerful use cases for their platforms. Some go vertical, specializing in certain industries, and that’s great… if that is a fit for your long-term needs. But for the organization that wants an open, high-productivity application platform that makes it easy to create, deploy and manage enterprise mobile and web applications, OutSystems offers more value than any other solution on the market.

<strong>Voting for the CODiE 2014 winner has begun.</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Business is now more global, more immediate and more mobile than ever before. <strong>Mobile technology enables employees to always be in touch with the office, the customer and the business opportunity</strong>.If I’m on a train, at a client site, working from home, or travelling between meetings, I can be as productive as if I was at my desk.<!--more--> But today, mobility is about much more than just communication on-the-go. <strong>It’s about technology that enables the extended enterprise to connect and collaborate, linking customers, partners and employees to valuable online information services, from any device, virtually any place and at any time</strong>. It’s about opening the enterprise to value-added and innovative services that enhance its ability to reach customers.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cuf-example.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1926"><img class="alignright wp-image-1926 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/cuf-example.png" alt="cuf-example" width="310" height="247" /></a>Cisco recently published statistics that demonstrate how user demand is driving every enterprise down the mobile route whether they like it or not. <strong>In 2018, there will be 4.9 billion mobile users</strong>, up from 4.1 billion in 2013. Mobile traffic grew by 81 percent in 2013 and mobile video traffic exceeded 50 percent for the first time in 2012. Moving forward 66 percent of all mobile traffic is expected to be video by 2015. And according to IDC, total smartphone shipments are expected to approach 1.7 billion units by 2017, resulting in compound annual growth of 18.4 percent from 2013 to 2017.

While the stats are compelling, I’m not sure that the CIO is quite so enthralled. Mobility is fundamentally changing the interface of technology and is having a profound impact on enterprise IT and everything it does. The ‘bring your own device’ BYOD phenomenon in particular is causing IT considerable headaches. Right now, CIOs are being bombarded because everyone within the company wants to use the device in their pocket to access company data and processes. No one wants to lug a company laptop around anymore when they can simply bring their personal tablet into a meeting. Employees don’t see any distinction between personal and corporate information access either. They expect the same flexibility and user-friendly IT experience in the workplace that they have at home and don’t see why they should do what some old-fashioned IT director tells them.

As a result, <strong>CIOs must now consider how they are going to change the IT environment to accommodate how users wish to interact</strong>. They need to consider how they will create new mobile layers for existing applications and how they will build new applications ensuring that mobile is first and at the forefront of their strategy.

<img class="margin-right:30px alignleft wp-image-1927 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ISB-global-example.png" alt="ISB-global-example" width="310" height="247" />Equally, they must also consider what will happen if they don’t. Quite frankly this is where shadow IT is in danger of overwhelming the CIO as employees and departments create ‘workarounds’ sourcing their own solutions to problems. The CIO and his team will be blamed for impeding staff productivity, for lacking innovation, and for not delivering cutting-edge mobile applications to the business. Ultimately, the danger is the enterprise will disengage with IT.

Today, <strong>the whole enterprise application ecosystem needs to be multi-channel and organisations must have a mobile-first strategy</strong>. IT needs to be able to create once for all devices automatically, utilising responsive web design in their strategy. Additionally, mobile is so fast moving and with new apps constantly being developed, the CIO must create an environment where change can be managed quickly and effectively.

Over the years at OutSystems, we’ve helped hundreds of customers such as <a title="Randstad Case Study" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/randstad/customer-portal/">Randstad</a>, <a title="Fidelidade Case Study" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/fidelidade/it-factory/">Fidelidade</a>, Bacardi, <a title="ISB Global Case Study" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/isb-global/sap-mobile-application/">ISB Global</a> and many more create mobile apps that have transformed their business. We have changed the fate of many CIOs so that they are leading rather than following. In fact, our high-productivity platform enables customers to build, manage and change mobile and web applications three times faster than traditional methods. Through our visual modelling environment, we enable responsive design and the ability to create for multi-devices and multi-channel. Here is how we helped one of our customers, ISB Global. In just two months using OutSystems Platform, business software and systems consultancy, ISB Global created and deployed a mobile application that allows users to carry the power of SAP in their pockets. With tight integration to SAP Business One, it provides remote and field employees the ability to record and monitor customer service requests via mobile and web devices. The systems highly usable user interface design increases staff efficiency and reduces training needs because it offers a fine-tuned workflow free from the UI complexities of SAP.

So back to my opening remarks – like it or not, mobile has become a de facto part of global business, and we are all completely dependent upon it. If I’ve not convinced you, just look at the stats again. Believe me, ‘use any device’ is the way forward in the enterprise, and CIOs must respond and respond fast.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1950" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vmware-logo-e1408959466427.png" alt="vmware-logo" width="224" height="163" />A successful mobility program, at enterprise scale, requires fundamental changes in architecture and how IT approaches the creation, deployment, security and management of applications. As Forrester states, “Mobile is pushing aging web architectures to the brink. The three-tier architecture built for a browser-led PC world can’t flex, scale, or respond to the needs of a good mobile experience or the emerging requirements for connected products. Mobile’s volatility and velocity of change require a distributed four-tier architecture that we call an ‘engagement platform’ .”

Embracing mobile is much more than just thinking about shoehorning existing apps onto a small touchscreen. The hybrid cloud’s ability to securely integrate with private and public cloud resources is a natural fit for the mobile enterprises’ evolving needs.

OutSystems rapid application delivery platform provides three key areas of benefit for vCloud Air customers:
<ol>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Cross-platform development (mobile and web)</strong>: OutSystems Platform enables a ‘build once for all devices’ approach, leveraging responsive design to create mobile web and hybrid multi-device applications without extra effort. Your applications will look amazing and work seamlessly across all form factors, by default.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Easy integration with both existing cloud and on-premises systems</strong>: Customers can reuse open source connectors or create their own, connect to software packages, current apps, and existing databases, and mash up data from several systems with visual flows.</li>
	<li><strong>High-productivity</strong>: Coupling a fundamentally more productive and efficient development environment, powered by robust visual modeling to create sophisticated applications, with streamlined deployment and feedback capture yields stunning productivity gains.</li>
</ol>
Leveraging OutSystems Platform with vCloud Air, customers can benefit from a high-productivity platform that helps them address the new and ever-changing landscape of business demands and competitive pressures to create, deploy and manage a huge number of sophisticated applications.

The need for efficiency, speed and cost-savings are driving increasing numbers of enterprises to the cloud, and for many customers, vCloud Air is the perfect hybrid solution from a partner they already know and trust. We are pleased to be pairing the flexibility and fluidity of vCloud Air with the rapid delivery power and productivity benefits of OutSystems Platform, to give businesses the power needed to create an engagement platform for their mobile applications.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Respected analyst firms like IDC have model-driven application platforms on their radar. Why? Because high-productivity application platforms like OutSystems are fundamentally changing the way IT approaches delivering innovative business solutions, like mobile and customer-facing applications.<!--more-->

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IDC-paper-card.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1965"><img class="alignright wp-image-1970 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/idc-logo.png" alt="idc-logo" width="154" height="56" /></a>In a recent vendor profile, IDC analyzes OutSystems technology, competitive edge and market potential to help you decide if our platform is the right choice for your organization’s application development needs. Here are a few of the report’s highlights:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">OutSystems technology is a differentiator in the world of model-driven application platforms because it translates the application into Java and .NET while retaining the <a title="Liberty - Insurance Management System" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/liberty/insurance-management-system/">productivity and agility</a> advantages associated with model-driven development environments. This approach allows developers skilled in these languages and runtimes to use familiar IDEs and leverage the existing portfolios of libraries and components available for these large ecosystems.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Unlike most model-driven 4GL-like development environments, OutSystems supports deployment capabilities and rollback features suited for continuous delivery projects that are increasingly dominating IT investment today. These features empower <a title="DevOps" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/diagrams/lifetime/">DevOps</a> approaches currently making inroads in enterprise IT.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">The robust deployment support capabilities we’ve honed with on-premises customers will prove beneficial to platform as a service (PaaS) customers.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Because OutSystems Platform allows developers to <a title="Extend platform with your code" href="http://www.outsystems.com/videos/integration/extend-platform-with-your-own-code/">incorporate existing code</a> within their visual models, “it can be seen as more strategically safe than many alternatives on the market.”</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px;">With support for Java and C# on the back end and JavaScript and HTML5 on the front end, OutSystems Platform is useful for Web development and <a title="Enterprise Mobile Application Development" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/charles-river/internet-colony-management/">enterprise mobile application development</a>.</li>
</ul>
We are pleased that IDC recognizes the many benefits OutSystems Platform delivers.

		<title>OutSystems Platform 9 Launches!!</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2014/09/whats-new-in-platform-9.html</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After listening to customers and the market, countless development hours, sleepless nights, and an obscene amount of caffeine, we are absolutely thrilled to announce general availability of OutSystems Platform 9.<!--more--> With <a title="OutSystems Platform 9" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2014/platform-9/">this release</a>, we have realized the vision (and more) that we shared with our customers at NextStep in Lisbon this year. We’ve made huge and significant strides in making the creation, deployment and management of modern apps easier than ever before.

“<strong><em>So, uses-too-many-adjectives-guy, what’s really new?</em></strong>”

I’m glad you asked… First, we’ve merged the best and tossed the worst of mobile web and native mobile app development with the introduction of <strong>OutSystems Now</strong>.

<a title="OutSystems Now" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/enterprise-app-store/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1991" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/App-phone-icon-176x300.png" alt="App-phone-icon" width="172" height="296" /></a>It is our new native mobile app that can be downloaded from the Apple and Google app stores. Show it where your Platform environment is, give it your credentials, and it will present to you all apps that you have access to - an effortless <a title="Enterprise App Sore" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/enterprise-app-store/">enterprise app store</a>. That’s a pretty neat trick, given how hard it is keeping up with all the apps that are being created for different users in your environment. No more passing URLs around, creating brittle portals, folders on-device, users simply not being able to find their apps, etc. And since logging in to each of them individually would just be a drag, we handle that as well - log in once, go wherever you like. Ah, the freedom.

OutSystems Now does much more than this though, it is your gateway to native device function! Wait, what does that even mean? Well, it means that you don’t need to be an expert in ObjectiveC, Swift, Java, or C# to make some really kick-ass mobile apps for your employees, customers and partners. Simply use our new widgets for things like camera, geolocation, barcode scanner, and on-device app integration by dragging them into the visual model for your app. When your app is used from inside OutSystems Now, those sensors and device apps are seamlessly accessed and interacted with. Need to create an app that lets you take a picture of the fender bender you were just in, add geolocation data to it, request a tow, file a claim, then get a push notification when that tow truck is enroute? Not a problem...piece of cake, really.

<img class="alignleft wp-image-1981 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/connectors-blog.jpg" alt="connectors-blog" width="228" height="148" />Actually, for that example all you have to do is install one of the new app templates we’ve created and listed on the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/forge/">Forge</a> and you’re nearly finished...which is the perfect segue to talk about another area of ongoing effort that is debuting with Platform 9: open-source app templates and connectors. The aforementioned auto accident app is a perfect example. Go take a quick peek at the first set of templates we’ve created (field service, mobile order management, and more)! Along these same lines, we’ve released the first set in a series of connectors (Box, Dropbox, Zendesk, Twilio, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook), to make integration a breeze. Stay tuned, as we are just getting warmed up here. These apps and connectors join community-driven projects that already number close to 500 in the OutSystems Forge. Speaking of Forge, we’ve woven that experience directly into our development environment. Working on a project thinking that someone HAS to have done this before? You’re probably right, do a search, find the component/library/app/connector you’re looking for, one-click to install and poof...yet another shot of adrenaline injected into your app dev process, with the security that comes from global dependency checking and understanding when an install will work...and more importantly, when it won’t!

What’s the point behind all of that? Simply put: to push the amount of time it takes to go from inspiration to amazing app as close to zero as imaginable...and then maybe more. But wait a minute, what if someone actually HASN’T done what I need before, am I out of luck? Heck no!

<strong>Platform 9 introduces two more massive time-savers</strong>: visual RESTful API consumption and a new data manipulation construct called an Aggregate.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1982" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/web-services-blog.jpg" alt="web-services-blog" width="228" height="148" />Let’s start with REST, because it’s easy - right? As with everything, the devil is in the details. REST is great because it is lightweight, but that shouldn’t be confused with easy! SOAP was a bit heavier to deal with, but it did let you know exactly what to send to it and what to expect back. REST? Not so much. Let’s scroll through the Google API documentation...hmm, OK, here’s a sample URL call and a big ole blob of JSON for me to dissect. Wouldn’t it be great if there was something that would take that weak documentation and do the work of determining the calling and return structure, along with the parsing code to put it nice and neatly in a little ball I can use in my app? We agree. You’re welcome.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Aggregates-Datasource2.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1992"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1996" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Aggregates-Datasource2-300x168.png" alt="" width="245" height="129" /></a>Ok, while we are talking about saving you ridiculous amounts of time, let me introduce Aggregates. Its job in life is to automate 90%+ of the gnarly custom SQL code that developers have to deal with now. Drag one or more disparate sources of data into this handy little construct and it will...yep, aggregate it. We turn it into a lump of clay that you then use visual manipulation tools to mold into your sculpture. Pull data together, hide columns, group, filter, add computed columns, go nuts. Roll around in the live data like a spreadsheet on steroids. Developer-level analytics. Once you have the sculpture, you can use it like any other data - input to other parts of the app, custom logic, or straight to robust visualizations for the user. How much time did you just rescue? We just did for SQL what we already did for Java, C#, HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.

Hopefully my excitement doesn’t come off as boasting, we are just so very proud of <a title="What's New in Platform 9" href="http://www.outsystems.com/it-resources/#/it-resources/pdf/whats-new-in-platform-9/">this release</a> and can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on it. We hope you have as much success with it as we envision. And as always, don’t hesitate to get in touch if you run into speed bumps - annihilating those is our mission in life!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For many years, IT organizations invested millions of dollars in enterprise systems and databases (like SAP, Oracle, SQL Server and recently salesforce.com) and created an overwhelming level of enterprise IT complexity. Much of this was built from the bottom up - designing and selecting the right “back-end” servers, databases and “front-end” systems.<!--more-->

How about the user? Where did the user fit in all this? Well, users were doomed to change their ways in order to fit the newly implemented systems. They had to go through a painful learning process that would teach them to muddle through several different systems just to accomplish simple tasks.

How common are IT project failures? One of the most dramatic examples of how user-centered IT has become a critical issue is <a title="SAP Implementation" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/12/11/avons-failed-sap-implementation-reflects-rise-of-usability/" target="_blank">Avon’s $125 million failed implementation of SAP</a>.

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/graph1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2010"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2010" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/graph1-300x171.png" alt="graph" width="300" height="171" /></a>You got the point right? Systems exist to support users and business, not to hinder productivity and slowdown business. This has been a mantra at OutSystems ever since the company was founded. We want to enable IT to deliver top-notch user experiences fast and, most importantly, keep them fresh by changing them even faster.
Early this year, a global CIO round table discussed <a title="Delivering innovative systems" href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/2014/keynote/" target="_blank">leveraging Mobile, Cloud and Big Data to deliver innovative systems</a> that help companies drive more revenue, increase productivity, and are loved by their users. In enterprise mobility, the user experience is even more important for user adoption - which is paramount. So last month we published <a title="Why IT Struggles with Mobility" href="http://www.outsystems.com/enterprise-mobility/">Why IT Struggles With Mobility</a>, an ebook that further expands on the compounding challenges of mobility.

<a title="Liberty Insurance" href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/liberty/insurance-management-system/">Liberty Insurance</a>, an OutSystems customer, committed to build an entire IT governance model completely focused on the end-user, constantly monitoring feedback and taking changes to production in less than two days.

The good news is that industry leaders, such as Box, Zendesk, Jive, Marketo, Okta, and Skyhigh Networks, have joined forces to drive a new movement called User-Centric IT (UCIT) - putting users first and giving teams tools and information when, where, and how they want it. User-Centric IT is about putting users first, and we are proud to be a member of this movement.

The <strong>five core principles</strong> of the User-Centric IT movement are:
<ol>
	<li>User-Centric IT serves business by empowering people.</li>
	<li>User-Centric IT adapts to the way people work, not the other way around.</li>
	<li>People, information and knowledge must connect in real time.</li>
	<li>Mobility is a work-style preference, not a device.</li>
	<li>Security should be inherent and transparent to the user experience.</li>
</ol>
We encourage you to learn more about the <a title="User-Centric IT" href="http://usercentricit.com/" target="_blank">User-Centric IT</a> movement and how OutSystems Platform, starting with the user in mind, can help you transform your users’ mobile and web experience.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Several years ago we saw the Agile Manifesto grow from an "intentions" document to a global movement that ultimately pushed the old-fashioned-poised-with-inadequacies Waterfall model out of the big IT picture.

Hopefully this will also happen with User-Centric IT: a group of people who *get it* and start a small revolution, which will grow in size and relevance and put us in a place where everyone starts with the end-user in mind.

It will be great to see it come to fruition, and it makes me happy to see so many relevant companies pushing towards that vision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s not unusual for a company to have a love/hate relationship with mobile apps. Business users love the prospect of having another revenue generator and means of engagement, but nobody - especially IT - likes lengthening development queues and facing talent shortages. And, let’s be honest that’s exactly what mobile app developers in the enterprise are experiencing.<!--more-->

According to research by Opinion Matters, <strong>85% of organizations surveyed have a mobile backlog of between one and 20 applications</strong>. Meanwhile, the demands on development teams are increasing while the skills required to deliver on those demands are becoming harder to come by – 92% of respondents said developer vacancies constituted between 11% and 50% of their current team size.

Disgruntled developers are just the beginning when a company can’t deliver on its mobile app initiatives. Companies also risk losing potential revenue streams, competitive differentiators and potential efficiency gains from mobile employees. Fortunately, enterprises can reduce these risks by:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Automating</strong> - Understand where and when to automate to make the entire application lifecycle more efficient. Outsourcing – Carefully identify and outsource the low-level, low-value tasks that won’t put the organization at risk of being overly dependent on third-party relationships.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Staff training</strong> - Ensure that staff members have the development skills needed to keep up with business demands.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Developing once</strong> - Develop a multi-channel mobile app development strategy that enables your team to develop an app once for all devices.</li>
	<li><strong>Creating change maintenance</strong> - These processes enable developers to easily and efficiently update mobile apps with new features and functionality.</li>
</ul>
Companies face a number of challenges when it comes to delivering mobile apps, but by focusing on and optimizing available resources they can be overcome.

At OutSystems, we are continually working to make that easier for you, that is why <a title="Lessons learned from 100,000 mobile users - NextStep 2014" href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/2014/lessons-from-mobile-users/">Justin James’ presentation at NextStep 2014</a> rang so true. Justin shared lessons he and his team learned from building an app for 100,000 mobile users and I wanted to share these four lessons.<!--more-->

Wodify is a SaaS offering for <a title="Wodify Cross Fit box" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit" target="_blank">CrossFit</a> “box” (or gym) owners and their athletes. (WOD meaning workout of the day.) The all-in-one software gives owners the tools to run their business and athletes the ability to log their fitness results, monitor their progress, and stay more connected with their chosen box. Wodify was created on OutSystems Platform, and as the user base grew from zero to 100,000 users in less than two years, some valuable lessons were learned.
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Lesson 1: Your users are mobile – even if you aren’t</h4>
<img class="alignright wp-image-2050 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/blog-mobiledevices.png" alt="blog-mobiledevices" width="220" height="229" />It’s not unusual for a company to be lagging behind its users in terms of mobile maturity. Perhaps a focus on desktop applications has resulted in mobile falling by the wayside. Or the company simply hasn’t had the resources to build a mobile app development skillset.Meanwhile, mobile becomes a focal point of users’ lives, and the challenge of addressing users’ demands grows … and grows.

This was the case for Wodify. The company had focused on building out a desktop web app for box owners, only to find that this population represented a small portion of its users. The majority of users were their customers’ customers – the athletes who were using Wodify on their mobile devices.

As a result, the mobile app was not delivering the experience or functionality users expected. Wodify was missing a huge opportunity to further engage users and grow its business - but not for long!
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Lesson 2: If your app isn’t in an App Store, it doesn’t exist</h4>
Wodify provided a link to download its web app on the Wodify home page and within the desktop web app itself, but that wasn’t enough. Time and again the software company heard users ask, “Can’t I just download it from the App Store?”

<img class="wp-image-2040 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/app-store.png" alt="app-store" width="415" height="212" />Consumers expect to find you in the App Store and won’t look elsewhere – even if you tell them exactly where to go. Wodify learned that because its app wasn’t in Google Play and Apple’s App Store, it simply didn’t exist. However, something incredible happened once it was in the App Stores. Before Wodify made a single announcement about the app’s availability, it had been downloaded 41,000 times!
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Lesson 3: It’s far easier to create a great user experience from the beginning than it is to undo a bad review</h4>
In the desktop world, users tend to be more patient and tolerant of weaknesses in the apps they use. The mobile mindset is different. Users want to complete a task quickly and easily. They want apps to be user friendly and work flawlessly. If an app takes too long to load, doesn’t offer the right functionality or acts “buggy,” users don’t hesitate to write a negative review. Unfortunately, these negative reviews can have a lasting impact on downloads – long after the problems are addressed.

<img class="alignleft  wp-image-2073" style="width: 101px;" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/love-this-app.png" alt="love-this-app" width="101" height="302" />Wodify learned the hard way that it is much easier to create a great customer experience from the get-go than it is to undo a negative review in the App Stores. This means dedicating the resources to building the mobile app your users want right from the start. Don’t make your mobile app an afterthought and promise to throw resources at it as they become available.

Creating a great user experience also means building in mechanisms for proactively addressing user problems. Wodify now responds to every user who posts a bad review. They get insights on what’s occurring on users’ phones and perform a one-to-one fix. Not only does the mobile app improve from these efforts, but Wodify is building a name for itself as a company that delivers superior customer service.
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Final lesson: Go hybrid</h4>
The above three lessons point to one underlying lesson: build a hybrid app. A hybrid app, as opposed to a purely native or web app, enables you to give users the experience and native functionality they desire. It also enables you to make your app available in the App Stores, while embracing the speed-to-change benefits that mobile web apps bring.

<img class="alignright wp-image-2041 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hybrid.png" alt="hybrid" width="224" height="315" />Wodify built its hybrid mobile app by using PhoneGap. If you’re not familiar with PhoneGap, it is an open source framework that enables developers to quickly build cross-platform mobile apps using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. Wodify used PhoneGap in a manual fashion to extend the application built with OutSystems Platform.

The Wodify project verified what we at OutSystems already knew: It’s not enough to have a web-based mobile presence. Organizations need hybrid apps, and they need to be easy to build. PhoneGap helps companies get there, but OutSystems is making it even easier. With the recently released Platform 9, hybrid comes ‘out of the box’ with your OutSystems app, using open source Cordova for the native requirements,taking the pain out of creating a hybrid app. One of our many goals is to help you meet mobile users where they are.

And this is just one of the many ways we are doing that.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a lot of irrational exuberance that led to a lot of chaos involving the development of mobile applications in the enterprise, more rational approaches to building these applications rapidly are finally starting to gain sway.<!--more-->

The majority of IT organizations initially approached mobile application development one application at a time. The reason for this has to do more with failing to realize how pervasive mobile computing would be across the enterprise. The end result has led to everything from low developer productivity to outright project failure. In fact, <a title="Mobile Trends and Statistics" href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/mobile-trend-statistics/">a recent survey</a> of over 200 IT managers, conducted by Opinions Matter, found that nearly half admitted their organization was struggling to develop mobile applications.

To rectify this issue, enterprise IT organizations are starting to embrace a more platform-centric approach to developing mobile applications. These platforms typically allow developers to make use of any toolkit they want to access backend services and applications in a highly consistent manner. In addition to fostering the reuse of code and services across multiple mobile applications, they typically are integrated with a variety of mobile application and device management frameworks that serve to both secure mobile applications and reduce the total cost of managing them.

Ultimately, IT organizations want to be able to work from a single code base for every application to help keep their development costs to an absolute minimum. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that when appropriate they don’t want to be able to take advantage of a particular feature on any given mobile computing platform.

The good news is that as platform approaches to rapidly developing mobile computing applications continue to mature, developers no longer have to make compromises. Instead, they can continue to develop mobile applications using a single code base, while preserving the flexibility they need to optimize the attributes of that application as only they best can see fit.

The entire way mobile applications in the enterprise are developed is rapidly maturing. As a result, it’s also clear that organizations, which come to understand the importance of a platform-centric approach to developing those applications, will best realize the true value of a “Mobile First” enterprise.

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[After a lot of irrational exuberance that led to a lot of chaos involving the development of mobile applications in the enterprise, more rational approaches to building these applications rapidly are finally starting to gain sway.

The majority of IT organizations initially approached mobile application development one application at a time. The reason for this has to do more with failing to realize how pervasive mobile computing would be across the enterprise. The end result has led to everything from low developer productivity to outright project failure.]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<title>Ovum’s take - Make sure your Rapid App Delivery (RAD) solution can keep up</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2014/11/ovum-rapid-app-delivery-rad-solution.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We talk a lot about how a Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) solution like OutSystems Platform can enable IT organizations to deliver custom mobile and web applications more efficiently than traditional methods. But it occurred to me as I was reading a recently published <a title="On the Radar - RAD Solution" href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/app-development-paas/">On the Radar</a> by analyst firm Ovum how much the success of a RAD platform depends on the provider’s ability to keep pace with change.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/app-development-paas/"><img class="alignright" src="http://www.outsystems.com/CMS_BackOffice/ResourceLink.aspx?ResourceName=app-development-paas-outsystems" alt="" width="256" height="290" /></a>

<strong>The report states</strong>:

<em>In Ovum’s view, the core value proposition of OutSystems offering has stayed the same: rapid programming-free application development and deployment capability, with the solution staying in sync with the needs of modern enterprise development teams.</em>

<strong>And then later</strong>:

<em>In Ovum’s view, the OutSystems offering has kept pace with the changing application development landscape, and its support for mobile application development needs is especially commendable</em>.

The need for rapid application delivery goes back at least 13 years, when OutSystems got its start. But the pain points and challenges enterprises face today are quite different than they were back then. From the evolution of development languages, to the advent of mobile apps, to the role of enterprise apps as revenue generators, to Microsoft recently announcing that they would open source .NET, a lot has changed in application development. It doesn’t matter how fast you code if you can’t keep pace with technology churn.

Our goal has always been the same – to help enterprise customers create, deploy and manage custom applications more efficiently – but our offering has evolved in response to your changing needs. For example, OutSystems Platform helps enterprises build not just custom web applications, but also mobile and hybrid applications. It is also leveraged not only on-premises, but in the cloud and hybrid as well. The PaaS solution is easy to use and manage, and enables faster time to market. We evolve so customers don’t have to waste precious time there. Who has time to build bench strength in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - and it's ever-changing frameworks, integrating dev and ops, Java, C#, ObjectiveC - wait...I mean Swift, phones and tablets - oh and wearables, etc? It is never ending and daunting.

You know the visual of the duck smooth as silk on the surface of the water, while their legs are driving like mad underneath? We’re the legs - dealing with technology churn, advances in the state-of-the-art, changes in the landscape, etc. The cool-as-a-cucumber topside duck? That’s you.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2123" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/outsystems-technology-churn-duck1.jpg" alt="outsystems-technology-churn-duck" width="580" height="352" />
<p style="padding-top: 15px;">The applications we need to build and how we build them will continue to change. And OutSystems will continue to meet enterprises where they are, innovating to enable them to harness the trends that move their business forward.</p>

This is a very informative post and Jimmy does a great job of showing how hard it is to keep up with just one piece of the overall stack we're talking about here. We think the answer is quite a bit different than "keep doing what you're doing, but use microlibraries". We think it is "create stability and efficiency through abstraction"... Keep your eye on the prize, which is the end product, not the ever-changing ingredients.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mobile landscape is changing rapidly, with users demanding an ever more robust and evolving experience on any mobile device, from anywhere. As a result, enterprises are faced with an increasing <a title="Mobile Trend Statistics" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2014/mobile-trend-statistics/">mobile backlog</a>, which is directly affecting enterprise revenue and productivity. A recent <a title="Opinion Matters Survey" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2014/mobile-trend-statistics/">survey by Opinion Matters</a>, sponsored by OutSystems, found a broad-ranging, increasing shortage of skilled mobile developers.<!--more-->

<img class="style=&quot;padding-bottom:20px;&quot; aligncenter wp-image-2161 size-full" title="Rapid Mobile App Development" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rapid-mobile-apps.jpg" alt="Rapid Mobile App Developme" width="580" height="256" />
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">Analyst firm Gartner recently published a new market guide, <strong>Gartner Market Guide for Rapid Mobile App Development Tools</strong>, (Richard Marshall, Nick Jones and Jason Wong, November 19, 2014), which we believe is designed to help enterprises navigate the landscape of rapid development tools, which aim to simplify, through ‘low-code’ or ‘no-code’ offerings, mobile app development, to the point that anyone - developer or not - can use them.</p>
We are seeing an increasing number of customers turn to Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) solutions to help them solve the emerging mobile development challenge. Mobile is the ‘pointy end of the stick’, and it is becoming the forcing function for organizations to take a hard look at how they create, deploy and manage applications across all their platforms (web, mobile, wearables, etc) in the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible.

Besides including a list of representative vendors, including OutSystems, which offer cross-platform development (Android, iOS, etc), Gartner also provides some recommendations in the report, which we agree with. These include:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">“<strong>Experiment with different styles of rapid mobile app development</strong> (RMAD) tools and select a small subset that corresponds to organizational needs.”</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">“<strong>Verify the financial stability of suppliers</strong>, as many of them are small. Plan an exit strategy for each vendor; however, do not let vendor risk limit your adoption of innovative solutions.”</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">“<strong>Determine your key selection criteria</strong>, typically back-end integrations, skills required, device support and user interface (UI) capabilities.”</li>
</ul>
We believe this is sound advice. To address these recommendations, we suggest the following:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>We encourage enterprises to experiment with many tools before selecting one</strong>. OutSystems provides a <a title="Try OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/get-started/">free version</a> of its platform making it simple for individuals and organizations to experiment with our solution.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Ask potential vendors about their lock-in requirements</strong>. Many vendors will attempt to lock companies in, so that no matter how poor the user experience, they cannot leave if they want to take their code with them. Unlike proprietary technologies and closed frameworks, OutSystems generates <a title="OutSystems Platform - Standard Architecture with No Lock-in" href="http://www.outsystems.com/home/document-download/184/8/0/0">standard, optimized and fully documented source code</a> which does not require runtime interpreters or vendor-specific engines. With this approach OutSystems ensures that you won’t get locked-in to any proprietary technology, thus protecting your investment.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Evaluate what integrations are provided out of the box</strong>. Are you trying to <a title="Integrate everything with OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/integrate-everything/">integrate</a> with existing SaaS and enterprise systems, like salesforce.com, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft? Databases like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL or DB2? What about connectors and cloud services like Facebook, Zendesk, Twillio, LinkedIn or Twitter? Consider whether your provider has these pre-built, or if you will have to do heavy lifting to make them work. It’s also worth taking a look at other <a title="OutSystems customers" href="http://www.outsystems.com/customers/">customers</a> the providers have in your vertical, or who have built similar apps to what you’re trying to build, to determine if there’s anything within their knowledge base that can reduce your time to market for new applications.</li>
</ul>
The full Gartner Market Guide for Rapid Mobile App Development Tools, (Richard Marshall, Nick Jones and Jason Wong, November 19, 2014), is worth a read, and can be accessed here by Gartner clients: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/login/loginInitAction.do?method=initialize&amp;TARGET=http://www.gartner.com/document/2916717" target="_blank">http://www.gartner.com/document/2916717</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) markets are littered with solutions that attempt to solve various challenges application development and delivery (AD&amp;D) organizations face today.

So when Forrester recently released their Wave report on Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms, we were pleased to read their advice on navigating this space and choosing an appropriate solution.

The analyst firm highlights the value of PaaS as it applies to three different use cases or developer types. We at OutSystems are proud to have been recognized as a Leader for rapid development.
<!--more-->

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;" src="http://www.outsystems.com/CMS_BackOffice/ResourceLink.aspx?ResourceName=forrester-wave-public-cloud-platforms-thumb&amp;v=20141229214345" alt="" />According to The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms, Q4 2014:
<div style="margin-left: 30px;"><i>"Within the CIO’s domain, public cloud platforms empower AD&amp;D pros with frameworks, tools, and consoles that speed creation, deployment, and ongoing updates. Select the right platform and AD&amp;D pros will be highly productive."</i></div>
&nbsp;

The trick is identifying the right platform. Forrester advises that organizations choose a platform based on their developers and their needs.

The Forrester Wave report defines three types of developers. The primary difference between them is the amount of resource control that they want or need.

According to Forrester:
<ul>
	<li><i>Rapid developers want high productivity, not resource details.</i></li>
	<li><i>Coders want to program, not manage infrastructure.</i></li>
	<li><i>DevOps pros want configuration control when they need it.</i></li>
</ul>
We were pleased to see that Forrester identifies OutSystems as a Leader for rapid developers.

OutSystems Platform provides a no- or low-code approach to developing mobile and web apps once and deploying them to a variety of devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, web). In addition, DevOps principles like continuous integration and delivery along with application performance management are built into the Platform to support the entire application lifecycle. The Platform is designed to help organizations rapidly build and deploy quality apps, even if the organization has a skills gap. As Forrester puts it, “OutSystems includes extensive visual, declarative development and delivery tools, prebuilt applications and application components, support for both web and mobile application creation, and rich continuous delivery and application life-cycle management tools.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We hear it all the time: As the <a title="OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform">development</a> queue grows, so does the pressure on IT to deliver. Managers and executives want mobile applications yesterday, and IT is struggling to simply keep its head above water. As a result, many IT organizations are on a mission to reduce development time. Unfortunately, we’ve found that this only serves to move the problem to the right, so to speak. Let me explain.<!--more-->

<img class="alignleft wp-image-2203 size-full" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Super-RAD3.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="256" />Initially, at least, the choke point in application delivery appears to be the development team. Months pass, the backlog grows and the business demands to know why apps haven’t seen the light of day. Hand coding a mobile application for one platform can take weeks, even months – never mind coding it for multiple platforms. Organizations try to solve this problem by automating manual coding processes with rapid application development (RAD) tools. And it helps – to a degree.

RAD tools enable development teams to build applications faster so they can move on to the next project. But it doesn’t solve the ultimate goal – getting applications to customers faster – because applications must still be tested and the infrastructure configured. None of this is fully automated. The plethora of tools available for trying to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery must be manually configured and integrated using scripts. So now operations becomes the choke point in application delivery.

But the problem doesn’t end there, either. In some ways, it only begins when the application goes into production. As soon as they begin using an application, users have the expectation that improvements will be many and often. This puts the onus back on development to improve the mobile experience, deliver new functionality and fix bugs on existing mobile apps – in addition to developing new ones. The bottleneck has now come full circle.
<h5>Looking beyond development</h5>
The key to preventing these bottlenecks is to consider the application lifecycle as a whole. In addition to accelerating the development process using a no-code or low-code platform, IT organizations should automate the entire delivery process as well - from development, through test, and into production. A solution that combines all of these into Rapid Application Delivery ensures that no single point in the application lifecycle becomes a choke point. A Rapid Application Delivery platform that understands the dependencies between all apps and infrastructures can cleanly automate, verify and govern the delivery pipeline with single-click speed and efficiency.

Automating the entire application lifecycle also helps IT organizations transition to/embrace a DevOps culture. Because Development and Operations teams don’t talk to one another, share the same goals or use the same tools, DevOps can become particularly challenging when it comes to change management. A Rapid Application Delivery platform addresses these challenges. One platform controls the entire change management process, making it simple for Development and Operations to have a role inside of the platform and limiting potential errors that result in a failure. In short, a Rapid Application Delivery platform facilitates DevOps efforts without increasing risk.

A Rapid Application Delivery platform offers another interesting benefit. It can actually increase application adoption. Oftentimes users will open an application, use it once or twice and then decide whether to continue to use the app based on whether it is updated regularly. Users will stick with even a mediocre mobile app if they know that it is updated frequently and continually improving.

The successful and efficient delivery of a modern application requires that IT organizations consider the entire application lifecycle. Automating development at the expense of operations only serves to move the problem to the right and doesn’t address the ultimate goal: to get apps into the hands of the user. Adopting a DevOps mindset and automating the entire lifecycle with the help of a Rapid Application Delivery platform can do just that.]]></content:encoded>

From your perspectives, I am certain, you have come across Meyer's Law or approached very close to it yourself.

Meyer's Law, states "it is simple to make things complex, &amp; [but...?] complex to make them simple.

Sean, I am only starting out with OutSystems, but see much of its value, &amp; like you, it's pracrical application of Meyer's law.

Thanks so much for your kind words and encouragement. Welcome to the OutSystems community!

I completely agree with you - there is amazing power in simplicity. There is a companion rule to Meyers stating that flexibility is the enemy of simplicity. We spend our days (and nights) bending that rule to give our customers and unfair advantage in the fight.

I wish you nothing but success as you increase your usage of the Platform and please don't hesitate to let us know how we can help!

Best regards-
Sean]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>How I Built a Texting App and Connected to a Government Database - in 24 Hours</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I like hackathons. And one of the main reasons I like them is the limited time period the organizers enforce. I take particular satisfaction in delivering production quality and relatively large apps in less than 24 hours. I can do this because a large portion of the work is done with the help of a RAD tool - OutSystems Platform.<!--more-->

This hackathon was called “Govathon.” The City of Atlanta brought together government officials with problems and developers that could craft solutions to these problems. I was one of these developers. Following is my timeline with some short videos showing how I built the app.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2303 " src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Govathon-featured-e14238392461881.jpg" alt="Govathon-featured" width="590" height="241" />
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 7:00 pm </span>-- Getting started</h4>
The organizers of <a href="http://govathon.com/" target="_blank">Govathon</a> took 30 minutes to present their challenges to the nine teams. Teams assembled themselves around one or several similar ideas. I wanted to pick a project that was useful and would have a chance of being used by the city of Atlanta, and I got intrigued by what Angela Patrick from the building permits office had to say.
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 8:30 pm </span>-- A mobile app to access government data</h4>
Solving the problem Angela defined would lead to better customer service. People typically call the office to get an updated status on their building permits. There is a web portal but users could not find it easily and were often working at remote locations during the day. Angela wanted a mobile app so people could check their status without having to call the office.
OutSystems has a <a title="OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/get-started/">fully functional version of their platform in the cloud that is great for personal projects</a>. It is free forever and as long as you don’t need enterprise grade features it is more than enough. I registered and had my development environment up and running in minutes.
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 9:00 pm </span>-- Integrating with Excel</h4>
<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I was given an Excel document with the 60,000 building permits from the last few years, and I quickly created a database inside OutSystems Platform that could hold all the data.</span>

<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wk3bcf3skr" name="wistia_embed" width="100%" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 9:45 pm </span>-- The first mobile UI</h4>
<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Based on the data, I quickly scaffolded an initial prototype of the user interface using the standard ‘London theme’ that comes with OutSystems Platform.</span>

<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nokjxe96sf" name="wistia_embed" width="100%" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 10:30 pm </span>-- Going home to sleep</h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2357" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sleeping1.png" alt="sleeping" width="500" height="173" />
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 8:30 am </span>-- <span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Multichannel apps: Developing a text interface with Twilio</span></h4>
While getting dressed, I thought about the real-use scenario of this app. Adoption rates of mobile apps are ridiculously low if the real usage scenario is misunderstood. I wondered if a texting interface to query the database would yield better adoption rates. <a href="http://www.twilio.com" target="_blank">Twilio</a> to the rescue!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-2358 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/govathon-screenshot-mobile-device-e14240869589491.jpg" alt="govathon-screenshot-mobile device" width="590" height="361" /> Twilio is a telephony service, that among other things, enables apps to send and receive text messages. I integrated Twilio with my app using the REST capabilities of OutSystems Platform.
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 9:30 am </span>-- Twilio integration using a service callback</h4>
<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This sophisticated integration was made simple with OutSystems Platform. I created a Twilio account, which gives me a phone number. Any text message sent to that phone number generates a callback into my app. Check out how fast I did it.</span>

<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/7vvaombu3d" name="wistia_embed" width="100%" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 10:00 am </span>-- Publishing and running the app</h4>
<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This is how it works. Send a text message (SMS) to the phone number, then the app fetches the data from the database and sends the result back by text.</span>

<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uqbm2hylxm" name="wistia_embed" width="590" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 10:30 am </span>-- Live integration with the permit database service</h4>
<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I was done. I headed down to Atlanta Workforce Development headquarters and had some time before I was to demo and present my app at 3:00. But I could not resist some enhancements! The permit database is supported by <a href="http://www.accela.com" target="_blank">Accela</a>, and they have a great <a href="https://developer.accela.com/" target="_blank">public REST API</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd" target="_blank">Mark Headd</a> was nice enough to send me a couple of request/response examples that I fed into OutSystems Platform. Ten minutes later, I was able to connect my texting app to the live data of building permits of Atlanta.</span>

<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/lepbhhbjjn" name="wistia_embed" width="590" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 3:00 pm </span>-- Winning!</h4>
<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Govathon-1st-Place1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2381"><img class="padding-right:20px alignleft wp-image-2381 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Govathon-1st-Place-150x1501.jpg" alt="Govathon-1st-Place" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/eklementich" target="_blank">Eloisa Klementich</a>, co-founder of Govathon, announced the winners. Citing innovation and growth as a primary objective of the City, she was pleased to name my Building Permitting app as the winner of the fourth annual Govathon!

Now residents and businesses can check the status of their building permit applications in real time!

&nbsp;

RAD platforms work. OutSystems Platform allowed me to deliver a working SMS app with live integration in less than 24 hours - with some sleep included :)

Could you please explain the difference in the Hybrid Mixed, Hybrid Web and packaged Hybrid, this is a lot confusing. Why cant we simply have three variant as Native, Mobile Web and Hybrid instead? i feel this would simplify the whole thing.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Very readable and concise document, congratulations Rodrigo.

Really towards Occam's razor on the Application Architecture decision to the core elements that drive the technology decisions.

Would also note that there are a few other aspects of Enterprise Architecture that may be worth considering when during technology assessment:
- Company Device and Security policies required (BYOD vs specific set of devices)
- Audience of Application (Employees vs External)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">In a never-ending attempt to reduce the amount of time it takes to get <a title="changes incorporated into apps" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/iterate-rapidly/">changes incorporated into apps</a>, OutSystems has up-leveled your ability to properly capture context and user feedback directly - across all devices.</p>
<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/outsystems-feedback-app.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2558"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2558" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/outsystems-feedback-app.jpg" alt="outsystems-feedback-app" width="590" height="423" /></a>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;">Whether it be a QA engineer that spots something that doesn't quite look right or a business user that just wants that OneMoreThing™, the days of crude screenshots, emails, spreadsheets, and steaming abyss of unfindable requests are over. Use your tablet to let your development team know exactly what you want. Draw on the screen. Add a voice note ("I would love to see a graph here that shows the relative efficiency of my different service techs"), or just type something in. Everything the user sees and annotates gets balled up into a nice user story that developers can review in a beautiful interface that also allows them to jump directly to the screen in question and begin implementing the change. Ridiculously efficient and effective!<!--more--></p>
<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/change-management-simplified-user-feedback2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2549"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2549" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/change-management-simplified-user-feedback2-1024x575.jpg" alt="change-management-simplified-user-feedback2" width="590" height="331" /></a>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;">Yes, OutSystems customers have been able to do this for quite some time, but we've recently streamlined and extended it across not just web, but all devices. Not simply satisfied using a web metaphor on mobile, we've extended it to take advantage of the capabilities and likely workflow of each device at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">We hope you enjoy this update and that you use it to great effect further crushing cycle time. Want a sneak peek? Here's a quick video:</p>
<iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/jzg7dqcoku" name="wistia_embed" width="590" height="333" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;">Enjoy the awesome, let us know what you think in comments!</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I had the opportunity to test this out and I think it's really awesome. 

The concept of using the mobile device usage patterns  to let users draw on the screen and add a voice memo to their feedback is brilliant! It provides developers with all the information they need to truly understand what the users mean (which many times is practically impossible). 

In the past, I've received my share of emails with screenshots and text descriptions of what users think is wrong or could be improved... and I felt the pain of trying to figure out what the hell they meant (not to mention the painstaking process of managing the feedback looks with email).

This way of capturing and managing user feedback is great and truly helps any development team in being able to respond to users quickly and effectively. 

I love the way this new feature came out!

		<title>The 5 application development myths you need to ditch in 2015</title>

It seems that as the market evolves and some of the old trends vanish in thin air, a new set of myths pops up and percolates throughout organizations big and small. So today, although we’re already a couple of months into 2015, I want to write about the top 5 app dev myths you should leave behind this year in order to be truly successful.<!--more-->
<h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">#1 - We don't build anything, SaaS is enough!</h3>
I keep hearing companies say they don't need to develop any app to address their business needs because they can find everything “off the shelf” through SaaS. What’s worse, they think that SaaS means they will have a fast time to market.

Although for very generic business processes (like payroll) this might be the case, the idea that SaaS can solve all your business needs without any customization is more than short-sighted - it’s almost delusional.

Every organization has a set of unique processes that set it apart from its competition (the so called “secret sauce.”) The fact that those processes are unique to the company means they cannot fit in any existing package, because it’s not an industry standard. What’s worse, SaaS packages can’t truly be customized, and at most, they provide limited parametrization capabilities. This means you won’t be able to fit your secret sauce anywhere, and you’ll end up with huge white spaces that don’t cover your processes. Therefore, there will always be a need to build custom applications and workflows that support those processes and the company’s innovation.

Another problem you might face is SaaS-sprawl. Continuing down the SaaS path creates a significant number of silos - and even if you can bend the SaaS to your will - you’re going to have a hard time weaving together all those silos.

If you support your business only with SaaS packages then you have nothing that differentiates you from your competition and you’ll probably stay stale forever, or worse case, go out of business.
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">#2 - My mobile partner is my marketing agency.</h3>
IT departments have been stretched for years, and the growth of mobile has just made things much, much worse. As a result, some business units have taken mobile into their own hands and decided they don’t need IT to create the mobile apps business users need. Because many of the first mobile app requests come from Marketing, for many the solution has been to outsource the development of these apps to existing marketing agencies. At first it makes sense, because these agencies are smart and staffed to deliver B2C apps for Marketing campaigns and brand awareness. In addition, Marketing departments have nice chubby budgets.

However, looking past Marketing and considering transactional B2B and B2E apps that business users need, agencies are generally not the way to go. Business typically need to integrate existing systems (SAP anyone?), and create workflows across departments, customers and partners. You don’t need one app to start with, you will need 10. And the budget you have will make any agency smirk at you. When it comes to enterprise mobile apps, the agency play is not the way.

Marketing agencies are not the solution to solve your enterprise mobile application needs (unless, of course, you’re a marketing agency).
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">#3 - DevOps in the Cloud is just about Ops in the cloud…</h3>
I’ve heard many IT folks saying they believe they can continue developing cloud applications using the same old development processes they have been using on-premises. If you do that, you’ll be losing on one of the biggest opportunities the cloud has to offer: the ability to evolve your app delivery process and embrace some <a title="DevOps Principals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">DevOps principles</a>.

The virtualization of your servers to the cloud opens the door for developers to extend their reach and work closer to operation teams in delivering better apps. For developers, the cloud changed the Release Management process and they can now have much more control and flexibility over the deployment process of their apps. As another example, cloud environments can make application logging information readily available to developers, which they can then use to identify app issues and work on improving the overall performance and usability of apps. In traditional on-premises environments that information was usually locked behind the operations team’s data-center realm - inaccessible to common developers.

Moving to the cloud and continuing with the old ways of development vs. operations is to limit the return on investment from the start. Not smart.
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">#4 - If the software delivered is big enough, it makes sense for the project to take two years.</h3>
This is so 1990s! The justification usually goes something like, “Hey, we are a big company with big responsibilities. It is common for a valuable software release to take forever.”

Turns out, IT gets surprised that the world did not stand still and those pesky business users changed their minds several times. For the sake of reason: a two-year project should be considered dead on arrival. Don’t even start it!

The tools (RAD and <a title="Productivity Platforms" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/events/web/high-productivity-paas/">Productivity Platforms</a>), the infrastructure (Cloud), and the delivery (Agile) have proven they work and that a two-year long project can be delivered in six months. These RAD projects can be effectively delivered with several iterations and with continuous user involvement - ensuring it is adopted and actually solves the intended business problem at “go live.”

Two-year projects are no longer acceptable, no matter how big your company is. Period!
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">#5 - Integration is much easier with everyone moving to REST APIs and most systems being SaaS.</h3>
That may be true for folks who never had to work with a REST API before. It’s definitely not true for people that need to build an app that is the composition of 17 (mostly external) systems each with an average 200 entry-point APIs. Things get even worse if you need to make sure that the SLAs of all those systems return their API responses fast (they don't need caching) and reliably (they don't need failover), so that they don't impact the adoption of your portfolio of mobile and web apps. Good luck!

Integration continues to be one of the toughest challenges (and biggest failure points) of most IT projects, and <a title="REST API" href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/2014/rest-made-easy/" target="_blank">REST APIs</a> and SaaS are not the final solution yet.
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">How about you?
Have you seen other myths that make you want to slap someone in the face?

		<title>Visual Programming Is Unbelievable... Here’s Why We Don&#039;t Believe In It</title>

Visual programming has been an unfulfilled prophecy for years. As so many other areas, like virtual reality, artificial intelligence, or speech recognition, when the hype was high, the underlying technology wasn’t there yet.

But that was not its only problem...<!--more-->
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Several Misfires</strong></h5>
For visual programming, the hype peaked in the early 90s with CASE tools. And, as with all trends ahead of their time, the repercussions of its failure were years of underinvestment, little innovation, and lingering skepticism.

UML (Unified Modeling Language), with its promise of bringing sanity to object-oriented programming, hasn’t helped either, although much of its faults were due to the underlying complexities related with inheritance.

And even more recent trends, like Business Process Modeling, probably did more harm than good in giving credibility to this area.
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="wp-image-2736" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog2.png" alt="CASE tools, UML, and BPM all failed to deliver on their promises" width="400" height="92" />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;color: #808080">CASE tools, UML, and BPM all failed to deliver on their promises</span></p>

<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>No Silver Bullet</strong></h5>
In his seminal <a title="No Silver Bullet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank">No Silver Bullet</a> paper, Fred Brooks stated that there is no single development which, by itself, promises one order-of-magnitude improvement in productivity, because technology complexities would decrease, but requested features would not.

Like Moore’s law on hardware, the first part of that sentence proved to be prescient almost 30 years ago. What Brooks might have missed is that this would make room for too many directions in software development, often making us move in circles, instead of forward.

An example is the explosion of the number of languages, idioms and practices, sometimes with opposite approaches (e.g. strongly/weakly typed, client-server/server, all the different new JavaScript frameworks, etc...). Non-functional requirements, like scalability or security, and new expectations, like mobile and user experience, have only made things harder.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog3.png" alt="blog3" width="100" />

All this complexity opens space for an approach that would allow developers to focus more on delivering real value. Visual programming, with its higher level abstraction, could be the champion for this approach and become the productivity silver bullet we’ve been looking for.

So why hasn’t it yet?

Because visual languages have a fundamental set of problems:
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Visual Languages Aren’t Extensible</strong></h5>
This is probably the capital sin of visual languages. They allow you to do a limited set of things easily, but edge cases are far too difficult, or even impossible to achieve. Tools should give us more power, instead of limiting us.
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Visual Languages Generate Slow Code</strong></h5>
Every developer who has faced performance problems knows how hard they are to diagnose and overcome. Visual languages are leaky abstractions, often generating slow code which is impossible to optimize.
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Visual Language Tools Can Be Terrible</strong></h5>
We live and breathe in our IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). When they are poor, they can make our lives miserable! Visual languages and IDEs should be designed together: our love or hate for a language is a direct measure of our love or hate for its tools.
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Visual Languages Lock You In</strong></h5>
Any technology decision brings a level of lock in. The fear of being locked into a dead-end is justifiable, given that most visual languages generate unreadable lower level code, only target niche segments, are supported by suicidal startups, or haven’t left the research lab yet (where amazing recent work, like <a title="Bret Victor's" href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/" target="_blank">Bret Victor’s</a>, is being done). Real success stories, of people using it in large projects, are still rare, and these communities are still growing.
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>You Are Neurologically Programmed to Reject It</strong></h5>
The problems in the previous sections are serious and, as visual language architects, we know it’s our responsibility to continue our work to address them, removing these limitations.

But there are deeper reasons why you don’t trust visual languages:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2738" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog4.png" alt="blog4" width="100" />

The first is related to our love for complexity. Although we might say otherwise, we all do, according to the father of usability, <a title="Don Norman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman" target="_blank">Don Norman</a>. Take musical instruments, for instance: musicians love them because they are hard to master. Think about legislation. Or even language: most poetry is hidden under complex sentences and words. We love the intellectual challenge of thinking difficult thoughts. Your mind is probably doing it right now, agreeing with these ideas, or checking if there is anything wrong or missing in them.

We need, however, to be careful with this, as we create deep moats against the rest of the world, and that brilliant xor swap algorithm I’ve coded today may be somebody else’s nightmare next year.

Like Steve Jobs said: “Simple can be harder than complex. But it’s worth it.”

The second reason is even more primitive: it’s fear of change. We take the time to acquire some expertise, and suddenly it seems our old weapons are no longer needed. But we’re seeing it wrong: our weapons are not to be able to do a malloc, or pointer arithmetic; they are to be able to divide a problem into smaller parts, to understand the process of iterating on its solution, to detect strange code smells, to discuss a diagram on a whiteboard, to refactor systems into better architectures.

Those are our real weapons, the ones we’ve been sharpening for years, weapons that, with higher level languages, become even more deadly to any problem that might cross our path. Fear not: a great developer will always be more valuable than any tool he works with.

And let's face it: there’s also social acceptance. We were here first, we bought the debut albums, we'd never be caught listening to the sellouts that make it easy for everyone.
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>We’ve Been Here Before</strong></h5>
Because of these instinctive reactions, anything that aims to democratize computing is met with skepticism. HyperCard, Delphi, Visual Basic, COBOL. We, the “real” developers, are too quick to point out their faults, and mock them with no mercy until they die, instead of helping them improve. Even JavaScript almost had that same fate during the DHTML days.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2739" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog5.png" alt="blog5" width="100" />

There is, however, an analogy that might better show us the future: The shift from text operating systems, like Unix and MS-DOS, to graphical user interfaces, like Mac or Windows, which suffered pushback from several computer experts at the time.

That evolution, which seems so inevitable today, brought us better graphic cards - which lead to better games, brought us the world wide web, brought us smartphones.

Can you imagine a world without these unbelievable things?
<h5 style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>So, Are We Finally Ready For It?</strong></h5>
Not sure: you may not, or you may feel we’re not - it’s fair either way. But try to understand your biases, and don’t be afraid to give visual languages a shot: there are several organizations like mine, in different domains, challenging the way software is traditionally delivered, and pushing forward the state of the art.

And even if, after trying them out, you still don’t see the bright future of visual programming, that’s fine: consider keeping an open mind and come back later, otherwise you might just end up in the wrong side of history.

Yes, I was aware of both, they are very interesting. From a very superficial point of view, I would say they both show their age - in opposite directions :). I haven't looked into them in a while, I'll have a deeper look.

We already have a product in the enterprise applications domain (where shared data is the most important asset, and integration with existing systems is a must have). Would love to have your feedback.

Curious to have your feedback. There will be always a learning curve of a couple of days, and some people that come from desktop applications development sometimes struggle with the paradigm shift to the web. The first videos of online training might seem a bit basic, but help consolidating some knowledge there, if needed.

The question which pops in my head is why would you write a blog post on a promises on visual programming rather than doing that via video? :P

Also I know there are areas which ultimately feel better when done visually (like monitoring).

I guess it's still about picking a set of proper metaphors and educating people. Or finding people which understand the suggested metaphors better. Both are tricky :)

Anyway, I'll be glad to see this making business people doing more basic coding themselves :)]]></wp:comment_content>

Regarding doing a video: that's actually an excellent idea, I might create a presentation or a video for this. But if you look closely the article is not only text, it has formatting and images to make it easier to digest. In any case you are right, text will always play a major role in any programming language.

And I agree with you, there are areas where visual is definitely even more appropriate, user interfaces being an obvious candidate.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have a theory that GUIs could be used to educate people how to be more effective on the command line and better at coding. The rise of Windows and Mac OS may be the result of 1) people are initially more attracted to something "visual" and 2) lack of good code scaffolding code has required us to write a lot of boiler plate.  Code scaffolding is getting super easy (see yeoman.io), and perhaps now all we need to do is build in some reminders of how to do each operation you do in a GUI could be more efficient from the command line. What if your Git GUI taught you the commands that it was running as it ran them? After hiking your mouse across the screen like a treasure hunt, are you really going to not just type out the command next time? This is a theory anyways, something I'm interested in testing. I think I'm going to write a GUI for pulling data from a sensor and sending it to an arbitrary database that shows you the commands being run underneath.  Then I'll collect usage metrics and see how effective it is at getting folks to use the command line (which will be conveniently always at the bottom of the screen). I'm inspired by the classes I've taught where some folks are doing basic file operations and it takes them 10x longer.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Steinert,

That is a good idea. There is some software does that, e.g. <a href="http://www.javelin-tech.com/main/images/feature/3d_autocad3_lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">autocad</a> has (or at least had) a small command window on the bottom that you can use directly and that shows the equivalent commands that you do in the UI. Very useful for expert users and those who want to become.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Tiago,

I fully understand what this article is about, but I wouldn't say it's caused by "Visual Programming", but by "Highly Abstract Programming".

Visual Programming, to me, is just another way of presenting code. Some like it, some don't. For some uses it's apt (discussing, explaining, discovering), for some uses not so much (profiling, debugging). And it can be exchanged easily: same information can be displayed as diagram or code, no problem about that at all.

Highly Abstract Programming, to me, is what we've been and are trying with CG, CASE, MDA, DSLs, you name it. All the issues you mention apply here, independently of text or diagram. BTW, my opinion is, there will be no alternative to this kind of programming in the nearer future (it might be named differently, then).

Kind regards,
Andreas]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Andreas,

Yes you are right, most stuff applies to all high abstraction languages. 

Regarding profiling and debugging, I think that was a problem a lot more present in old visual programming languages, but visual representation can actually help there (e.g. highlight traveled code paths, show charts of timings, etc...).

I've focused more on visual because our instinctive biases are even more present for visual languages. 

Programming can never look that easy!

Thanks for your feedback,
Tiago]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Ovum Decision Matrix: MADP - Why You Should Care</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well-known and widely respected analyst firm Ovum just released their marquis research, the <strong>Ovum Decision Matrix: Selecting a Mobile App Development Platform Solution, 2015-16</strong>. Michael Azoff, Principal Analyst and author of this report, highlights what companies should be looking for in a MADP solution and then provides detail on where 12 different vendors fit against those criteria. We are gratified to be named a Leader in the space.<!--more-->
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2980 size-full" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/madp-decision-matrix-ovum-outsystems-social-e1427728253475.png" alt="madp-decision-matrix-ovum-outsystems-social" width="500" height="291" /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Given the amount of time, energy, money, anxiety, and attention that is being aimed at enterprise mobility right now, this report is quite timely. Enterprises all over the globe are trying to figure out how they’re going to tackle the daunting task of mobile app dev. The problem is complex, but the solution doesn't have to be. Seriously.</p>
Mobile apps generally start as a persistent request from one or two spots in the company, mainly referring to a consumer-facing wave of apps. Many times, this turns into a side project to simply placate those groups. What people don’t typically prepare for is the tsunami of employee- and partner-facing apps that are directly behind that first ripple, which turns that side project into a strategy. Unfortunately for most, that strategy is destined for failure.

An interesting aspect of this Ovum evaluation report is the importance given to features that support three strong emerging trends in the Mobile App Development Platform space which have not been obvious to the casual “mobile dev tool” evaluator:
<ol>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The convergence of mobile and web development</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The explosion and validity of visual rapid dev tools to support the prototype-intensive nature of mobile app development</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The importance of supporting the full lifecycle of these apps beyond just development.</li>
</ol>
Ovum is clearly getting the same type of inquiries and needs from their clients that we at OutSystems have been experiencing in the field and which have steered our roadmap:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“<em>Ovum is impressed with OutSystems because of the complete end-to-end nature of their solution for the rapid development and delivery of mobile and web applications. Its enterprise-grade features and functionality cover the entire mobile app lifecycle, in addition to providing a complete platform for delivering custom applications across all devices.</em>” - Michael Azoff, Principal Analyst, Ovum</p>
Please be our guest in reviewing this <a title="MADP - Ovum Decision Matrix" href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/madp-decision-matrix-ovum/">great piece of research</a> and see if you come to the same conclusion.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>OutSystems Platform 9 Amsterdam: RAD is Here to Stay</title>
		<link>http://www.outsystems.com/blog/2015/04/outsystems-platform-9-amsterdam.html</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“<em>RAD tools have been plagued with a bad reputation, and in most cases, it’s well deserved. This market category is filled with incomplete offerings that are limited and don’t properly handle the requirements of large organizations. With this release of OutSystems Platform, we are reinforcing our position as the only RAD platform that addresses the needs of the enterprise in terms of governance, scalability and security without compromising rapid delivery</em>.”<!--more-->

That quote is from our CEO, Paulo Rosado, in today’s Platform 9 Amsterdam <a title="Introducing OutSystems Platform 9 Amsterdam" href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2015/introducing-outsystems-platform-9-amsterdam/">press release</a>. Let’s make no mistake, we believe that RAD is the future of app delivery. OutSystems has been focused on making an application platform that has what it takes to fit a wide range of use cases, from the single developer creating a few apps, to a complicated enterprise IT organization. We do this because we believe in the future of RAD and are frustrated by other market offerings that give the true capabilities of this approach a bad name or implied limited scope. Ones that create a “wall” users hit either in development or in their attempts to mature usage across the company.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3299 size-full" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/omnichannel-themes.png" alt="omnichannel-themes" width="469" height="214" />

We spend countless hours honing, refining, extending, and advancing the state of the art for rapid application delivery. We do this while ensuring that we have a solution that scales from the early moments of one app to the inevitable challenges of maturing to deliver full-fledged mission critical applications in complex scenarios - companies with many development teams, large application portfolios, and all the headaches and corner cases that come with it.

With OutSystems Platform 9 Amsterdam, we’ve introduced functional extensions in the product that focus on making it easier to adopt RAD platforms at scale. When we say scale, we mean both the applications themselves and platforms viability. Dozens of developers working on hundreds of apps requires a serious approach to portfolio governance. Policy federation, granular and flexible group security rules, enforcement of organizational architectural standards, auditing, and more are simply required to work in today’s enterprise.

Doing all of this without compromising our core principles of rapid delivery continues to be our focus and you will see a number of enhancements along these lines today:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Integrate Everything</strong> - allowing for separation of back-end and front end, or going full-stack</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Omnichannel Experience</strong> - new modern responsive UI framework, with a RAD twist</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Rapid Iteration</strong> - connecting with end users in interesting ways to capture feedback and increase adoption</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Openness</strong> - expanded stack and platform support</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Pre-built Acceleration</strong> - more template apps and connectors to kick-start customer delivery</li>
</ul>
We are quite proud to announce the immediate availability of OutSystems Platform 9 Amsterdam. Existing customers have access to <a title="Download OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/home/downloads/" target="_blank">download</a> it for their on-premises installations, and our public cloud customers can contact us to begin their upgrade process as well. For all our personal environment users, you can <a title="Upgrade the OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/forums/discussion/14672/how-can-i-upgrade-my-personal-environment/" target="_blank">select to upgrade</a> right now.

We have plenty more to tell you about the release, feel free to <a title="What's New in Platform 9 Amsterdam" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/whats-new-in-platform-9-amsterdam/">read all about it</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Beware the Second Wave of Vendor Lock-In Fueled by Salesforce.com’s Vertical Strategy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/04/10/salesforce-continues-to-target-revenue-growth-with-new-industries-strategy/" target="_blank">Salesforce.com announced its new industries strategy</a>, analysts predicted it would be the catalyst for a “second wave of SaaS adoption.” But as the SaaS provider rolls out verticalized offerings built on the Salesforce1 Platform, it will also become the second wave of vendor lock-in.<!--more--><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3347" style="margin-bottom: 5px;" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/no-lock-in-200x195.png" alt="no-lock-in-200x195" width="200" height="195" />

With its Industries Business Unit, Salesforce.com is looking to expand into six vertical industries: financial services/insurance, health care/life sciences, retail/consumer products, communications/media, public sector and automotive/manufacturing. The company hired experts who previously held a C-level or VP position in his/her respective industry to lead each group in building vertical apps on the Salesforce1 Platform.

Traditionally, industry-specific apps are in-house or custom developed solutions - and for good reason. The technologies are not only specific to the industry, but to the needs of the individual companies. In some cases, these apps serve as a competitive differentiator. A packaged solution is simply not an option.

Salesforce.com is trying to make it an option by offering vertical-specific apps that can be customized by the customer and that run on Salesforce1 Platform. For companies that want to modernize their legacy apps, a customizable SaaS offering might seem like an attractive option. The problem, however, is that Salesforce1 Platform is its own standard. You may eventually have a custom app for your organization and vertical that does almost exactly what you want it to do, but you are stuck on the Salesforce1 Platform because it is not an industry-wide standard. The result: vendor lock-in. If Salesforce.com raises its pricing structure or otherwise falls out of favor, you have no choice but to continue to pay, or completely rewrite your app elsewhere.

There are other options for modernizing legacy vertical apps that not only allow companies to reap the benefits of SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud) but also allow you to retain control of your intellectual property and data. A Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) solution like OutSystems Platform gives you access to all of your existing systems as building blocks for the new system you are building. You can build custom systems of engagement all through a visual model-based development environment, ensuring that you get the exact app you need to run your business - without being locked into any vendor.

Salesforce.com had no choice but to hire a team of industry veterans to pre-build vertical apps based on Salesforce1. But you already have the expertise you need. You know your business from top to bottom, and you know your core differentiation - where you innovate. With a RAD platform, you can take advantage of that knowledge - as opposed to someone else’s - and turn it into an application portfolio extraordinarily fast that perfectly fits your needs without the risk of vendor lock-in.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the two years since we launched our free online training page, we’ve been paying attention to feedback from our developers and community members. So we've been working behind the scenes to enhance the online training experience and make it even easier to learn OutSystems Platform.

Here’s what’s new...<!--more-->
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Different Training Offers for Different Needs</h3>
Getting up to speed fast with a new technology is critically important. For this reason, we have three different ways you can start learning with OutSystems Platform:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Online Training</b>: Developers can get started right away and leverage the OutSystems community to share and learn. Online training is free.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>New! Online Class</b>: In this two-week class, developers can engage in a self-paced, instructor-assisted course. Online classes are free.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Developer Boot Camp</b>: An intensive one-week, on-site training experience where developers learn through hands-on training.</li>
</ul>
Because we care about the OutSystems community and are proud of it, we improved the OutSystems online training experience. This way you can access awesome training materials when you need them, where you need them. And for free!
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Introducing Multiple Courses</h3>
We know how important it is to have content that caters to novice OutSystems developers, but also helps you progress and become an expert. That's why we've updated our online course curriculum.

The online training now features three courses:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>OutSystems in an Hour</b>: Create a mobile contacts app, and get the hang of OutSystems IDE.</li>

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Easy-to-Search Videos With Transcripts</h3>
You've asked for it, and we listened! Everybody was having trouble searching certain topics that were hidden inside the videos. With transcripts, you no longer need to watch the whole video to find the topic that interests you. Just jump directly to it!

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3379 size-full" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/training-video-transcripts.gif" alt="outsystems online training with transcripts" width="400" height="436" />
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Asking Questions Made Easy</h3>
We made it super easy to ask questions. You no longer need to scroll down to the end of the discussion thread to ask a question.

And now you can even reference a specific time frame when asking questions.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3380 aligncenter" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/training-qa.png" alt="outsystems training post your questions" width="400" height="379" />
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">This Is Just the Start!</h3>
So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/learn/" target="_blank">Visit the training page</a>.

This is only the beginning.  You can expect more changes in the months to come, as we're planning to add more training materials, and improve the ones that are available right now. We're also working on new features for the training pages that we think you'll enjoy.

We hope you're enjoying your OutSystems experience!]]></content:encoded>

I specially like that "Mastering OutSystems". Some of the folks in the community might not know about it but I'm pretty sure many would appreciate them - why not a forum post?
By the way, there could be more "advanced developer" and "support enginer" bootcamps...
I think there is more good content out there, but disperse, not easy to find.
This is me, pushing for more!
Good job. Congrats!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The demand for enterprise mobility continues to grow with no signs of slowing down. Every customer-centric company has projects underway to transform the digital experience and delight users. Because every customer has a mobile device in their pocket, there has never been a better time to concentrate IT efforts on creating apps with mobile context and value.<!--more-->

With the market for mobile application development still maturing, the plethora of tools available to help address your enterprise app portfolio needs can be overwhelming. So, we took some time to really understand what tools are available, what categories they fall into, what stage of the development cycle they address, and what functions they perform.

The resulting reference architecture matrix (below) shows that you'll need a complex chain of interwoven point solutions to achieve enterprise mobility. It also illustrates how a rapid app delivery approach can offer dramatic speed improvements with streamlined full-lifecycle simplicity.

We also took this reference matrix one step further and built a complete architecture reference guide to help our community gain a better understanding of the mobile landscape. I invite you to take a look at our matrix and <a title="Navigating the Mobile App Dev Landscape" href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/mobile-app-dev-landscape" target="_blank">download the full eBook</a> to see all the options available for your development organization.

" width="590" height="284" /> Mercy Ships serves developing countries all over the world.[/caption]
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">When we set out to <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2015/custom-online-registration-app/">overhaul our volunteer application process,</a> we knew we had unique requirements, which would likely mean we’d have to custom build our online registration app. We wanted to make our HR department more efficient, but also wanted to make the application process easier and, hopefully, more accurate. Each year we use the skills of 1,200 volunteers, and up until recently, each of those submissions were filled out and processed by hand. Between difficult-to-decipher handwriting, poor quality scans or faxes and data entry mistakes, the application process was fraught with the potential for error.</p>
We searched for a product that would get us beyond the old-fashioned paper application and move us online. We ran into numerous hurdles because our application process isn’t a one-size-fits-all. We hire everyone from trauma surgeons to ship captains, from administrative positions to deck hands and needed a system that would allow us to tailor the process to our unique specifications.
<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20pxx;"><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mercy-ships-online-application-tool2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3459"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3459" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mercy-ships-online-application-tool2-300x195.jpg" alt="mercy-ships-online-application-tool2" width="203" height="132" /></a>            <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mercy-ships-online-application-tool4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3460"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3460" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mercy-ships-online-application-tool4-300x167.jpg" alt="mercy-ships-online-application-tool4" width="237" height="132" /></a></p>
We’d given up in our quest to find a flexible, off-the-shelf product that would integrate with our legacy database and while also providing cross-browser functionality, when our CIO was introduced to OutSystems Platform. He knew immediately this was what we needed. We did a 40-day trial demo, building a proof of concept to make sure we could talk to our internal database.

[caption id="attachment_3461" align="alignright" width="150"]<img class="wp-image-3461 size-thumbnail" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dr.-Gary-Hawa_SLE1105_VIP_PRES_VICEPRES_DB341A_m-150x150.jpg" alt="Hawa a former patient is greeted and welcomed by Dr Gary Parker." width="150" height="150" /> A former patient is greeted and welcomed by Dr Gary Parker aboard Mercy Ships.[/caption]

Once we were sure that was working, we signed the deal and started training. I worked with one other staff member - a developer - for six weeks and then after another two weeks, I was on my own. A few weeks later we kicked off installation - it was that fast! We conducted internal demos two months later and after writing some backend pieces and making a few modifications, we launched BETA testing.

OutSystems’ Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) platform really changed everything and allowed us to develop our custom online registration app in record speed. Now, our HR Department accurately captures all the information we need prior to submission.

		<title>Creating Custom Apps on Top of SAP? Well, Your Life Just Got Easier.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SAP customers can finally breathe a sigh of relief when it comes to digitizing the increasingly mobile customer journey. Our new enterprise edition of <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/sap/">OutSystems for SAP</a> enables organizations to quickly and easily build advanced, end-to-end applications that make the most of your custom SAP implementation and that run across all devices and screens - including web.

For decades, organizations have been trying to bend SAP to the will of the business, resulting in broken upgrade paths and an increasingly complex mess of custom code. This was generally done with ABAP programming, a skill that most mobile developers don’t possess - and likely don’t want to. This means that if I want to create a modern custom mobile app on top of SAP, I have a skills gap and life just got really painful. There have been plenty of tools tossed into the market over time to try and bridge this gap, but no holistic solution.

It’s no secret that the increasing demand for mobile applications and the resulting need to design powerful new digital experiences for all users are forcing companies to find better and faster ways of adapting SAP to new mobile customer journeys. OutSystems sees this shift as a good problem to have, as our primary goals are to embrace new trends, advocate for innovation, and maximize the productivity and value of enterprise apps for mobile users, given the massive growth of mobile devices.
<h3 style="padding-top: 25px;">Enter the New Enterprise Edition - OutSystems for SAP!</h3>
IT shops are continually challenged with finding new and more efficient ways to develop, deploy and manage applications. In our view, the chaos that modern mobile technology brings to IT, and in particular to SAP shops, is astounding and is creating an unnecessary burden for companies.

<img class="alignnone aligncenter" style="padding-bottom: 20px;" src="http://www.outsystems.com/cms_backoffice/assets/20150806105541/outsystems-sap-stabilize-complement" alt="OutSystems Platform and SAP" width="470" height="165" />

OutSystems has <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/sap/">helped our customers</a> with their application velocity and access demands time and again. And, we integrate seamlessly with various disparate systems. Specifically, the tight integration between OutSystems Platform and SAP allows organizations to retain the major benefits of SAP, while still delivering sophisticated applications with great user experiences.

OutSystems has successfully supported SAP customers in the past and our new edition is optimized for even greater benefits. These include:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Rapid development for SAP</strong>:  Deliver complex enterprise applications that use SAP data six times faster than hand coding.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Beautiful, purpose-built interfaces</strong>:  Create applications on top of SAP that can be deployed on any device.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Rapid integration</strong>:  Integrate all of your existing systems, including your custom SAP, no matter how complex.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Trusted capabilities</strong>:  Inherit what matters from SAP—security, governance, transactional integrity, and scalability.</li>
</ul>
Thus, SAP customers take heed: it really doesn’t have to be that hard anymore! See what OutSystems customers have to say about OutSystems for SAP, visit: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/sap/">http://www.outsystems.com/sap/</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This article was originally posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unleash-power-sap-rapid-application-development-roy-van-de-kerkhof">LinkedIn Pulse</a> on June 19, 2015.
</em>
<strong>A lot of companies are struggling with the question how to unlock the vast resources of their SAP installation for mobile development. Should we wait for the technologies SAP promises in its roadmaps or are there alternatives?</strong>

SAP has been around for a long time and during its time it has proven to be a secure, reliable and robust transactional system. Frankly, it is unrivaled as a system-of-record and will stay that way for many years to come. The technology behind it is mature and has proven to be able to guarantee data integrity and avoid data loss, while its performance is fully scalable to any size operation.

But however sound the technique behind their transactional system, SAP has been struggling with its UX strategy for years. New technology after new technology has been heaped up on the stack year after year, some of them developed in Waldorf, others acquired. If you are a typical SAP shop that has been around for a couple of years, you will now have at least developed web pages in ABAP Webdynpro, Floorplan Manager, Adobe Interactive Forms, WebUI - including BOL and GenIL –, and probably some more. Almost all of you will have at least one portal and possibly a federated portal. And when it comes to mobile, you might have done something with SAP Gateway and SAPUI5, but chances are you don’t have an app that is linked to SAP directly.

As you can see there is a plethora of technologies and tools you need to have on your team to support all this. Resources with these skills are pretty hard to find, but if you do happen to find the right people, having such a big team is on the expensive side and inevitably adds complexity to projects. A bigger problem is that SAP can be quite erratic in their choices of tools. Sometimes web and mobile technologies that had been presented as their new flagship technology were abandoned a couple of years later again (e.g. Webdynpro for Java), making your investment in these technologies useless: the code created was completely locked into the tool and you had to simply start over. Examples like these show that you can’t blindly trust SAP’s roadmaps when making your technology decisions.

This lock-in is a serious issue. All the technology tools SAP offers have some form of lock-in, meaning you can’t simply take the code you created and use it independently. The result of this is a reduction of flexibility: if you would like to develop for a new device, for instance Microsoft Hololens, you would have to wait until SAP comes with an update of their library to support this. Because of your investment, you will not walk away from the SAP tool, but will wait for the update. But if this takes too long or SAP has no plans to support the new device, what you really want to be able to do is to pick up your code and move to a platform that does support all of your business scenarios. The same goes when a great new platform comes to the market that clearly outcompetes your current one: you want to be able to pick up your current code and move it to the new, better platform.

It is clear that SAP is an excellent system-of-records system. And that is exactly what it should focus its attention on: to stay the best system-of-records system on the market. However, the matter of the fact is that SAP has proven that it can’t currently meet the high standards for omnichannel development to create beautiful user experiences on all devices. This is a problem, because research shows that mobile phones are now the prime window shop for customers, while also becoming the preferred choice of connecting to the network for enterprise workers. If you are not out there with great apps that fully use the latest technological possibilities you are losing business. And that app should be tied directly into your backend transaction system for the best possible responsiveness to the people using it.

The current fast pace of online application development asks for a whole new way of development. There is a large demand for fast delivery of mobile applications that are both performing well, are easy to change to new demands or technologies and that captivate the customer with a great online experience; but on the other hand there is a similar demand for a slower moving, but extremely reliable transactional system-of-records system to administer the business. Because of their contradictory nature these two are incompatible on one system, so the only possible answer is to separate them and adopt a two-tier strategy:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3516" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two-tier-technology.png" alt="two-tier-technology" width="607" height="308" />

What this allows you to do is leave SAP as your transactional backend and stop developing frontend applications on it. This will leave your SAP environment cleaner, faster and more stable, so it can be what it is supposed to be: the transactional system that crunches your numbers.

At the same time you have a tier 2 platform on which you can rapidly develop and deliver applications to your employees and customers that will delight them. If you only use standard SAP objects this will not only keep the SAP code stack clean, but also free your application development team from the rigid release schedules that most SAP systems are subject to, meaning you can deploy your applications to production independently, allowing for true agility and Rapid Application Delivery.

There are many RAD platforms out there, but only two have reached the maturity that allows for very robust and performing integration with SAP: OutSystems and Mendix. While Mendix is well suited to create your BPM and Workflow, it lacks capabilities in terms of rapid omnichannel application development and has limited capabilities when it comes to solution deployment and DevOps.

OutSystems on the other hand has evolved into a complete RAD platform with intuitive code-less application development with seamless SAP integration. Also, OutSystems has invested heavily in Application Lifetime Management and has included mature deployment and monitoring options in their system. Currently OutSystems is the only RAD Platform capable of connecting to SAP natively and possesses all the features needed for developing for all devices imaginable. It also allows for developing a clear architecture for building your apps using SAP functions, to keep your platform maintainable and scalable. Your new technical SAP stack would change dramatically:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3514" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/simplify-sap-outsystems.png" alt="simplify-sap-outsystems" width="600" height="303" />

Separating your application development from your transactional backend does not limit your SAP investment. On the contrary: it unleashes the SAP system, so you can make full use of its data and functions without being held back by SAP’s technology decisions. You get the best of two worlds: a transactional diesel that does the math and adds the accounts in combination with a Rapid Application Delivery platform that allows you to develop agile applications for great user experience on any device.

<em>The following is a post by Miguel Lopes, Vice President of Product Management for <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/" target="_blank">OutSystems</a>. </em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/PartnerApps/Guest-Post-OutSystems--Speed-of-RAD-Meets-the-Simplicity-of-Azure">Microsoft's Channel9 Blog</a>.

&nbsp;

If you like the benefits of simplicity and scalability you get with Microsoft Azure, you'll love the speed you can get with OutSystems Platform, an advanced, complete Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) platform that's now available on Azure.

Let's face it: The days of building enterprise apps for the homogeneous corporate desktop are numbered, if not over. For IT, this shift has created an app logjam as it scrambles to address the reality of a modern, mobile workforce. That means new devices, new form factors, wildly varying screen resolutions and new requirements for mobile-native capabilities – like incorporating GPS functions, cameras, and more.

As if that weren't hard enough, there's the need to rapidly iterate, add new features, and integrate with both old and new enterprise systems, preferably in an agile-friendly way that can automate continuous delivery and integration as apps evolve over time.

And that's why we're here.

OutSystems has partnered with Microsoft to bring the power of rapid app delivery to Azure, giving enterprises a turnkey, full-life-cycle platform that lets you design, build, deliver, manage, and monitor enterprise apps faster than you thought possible.   <a HREF='http://www.mapbild.info/' TITLE='egypt businesses'>suriname companies</a> All with no vendor lock-in – there's no worrisome proprietary widgets or interpreters.

If you have a non-trivial investment in your existing .NET or Java code, no worries; you can weave it into your OutSystems Platform apps. The solution is truly enterprise-class, used by more than 500 prominent enterprise customers and tens of thousands of developers worldwide.

So if you're in the midst of your own app logjam and would like to increase your development and delivery velocity, take a couple minutes to check out OutSystems Platform! <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform" target="_blank">Watch a few demos</a>, then spin up a free OutSystems Platform environment in the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/outsystems/outsystems-outsystems-azure-intro/" target="_blank">Azure Marketplace</a>. You know Azure gives you simplicity, scale and flexibility. With OutSystems on Azure, you get that last critical piece: speed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Evaluate a Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) Platform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every customer is unique. After helping many customers execute successful software projects, one thing is clear - they all <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/poc-guide-rad-application-delivery/" target="_blank">follow a plan</a>. The best organizations gather the information they need internally about their resources and abilities, along with the expectations of project delivery for the near- and long-term goals. They’ll also go on a thorough fact-finding mission to gather all relevant information about low-code platform vendors to ensure their chosen platform fully supports the systems and needs of the organization.

With all that said, I’ve also seen many customers struggle with determining the right set of questions and evaluation method to use to get the results they desire. Often times, it’s the definition of a plan that enables an IT leader or team to get the process moving quickly.

Essentially there are five main components to planning a thorough request for information, proposal or quote. Of course, all criteria should meet the SMART project management acronym. They should be Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant to your organization’s needs, and Timely. Within this criteria, this kit, Rapid Application Delivery Platforms: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/select-mobile-app-delivery-platform/" target="_blank">The Complete Evaluation</a> and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/poc-guide-rad-application-delivery/" target="_blank">Proof of Concept Guide</a> outlines a set of steps that delivers you with a solid framework to begin the proof of concept journey.

<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/planning-for-rad.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3601"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3601" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/planning-for-rad-1024x420.png" alt="planning-for-rad" width="590" height="242" /></a>

The outline involves a dual level of planning, starting at the company-level and then moving to project-level planning. The plan has five major steps:
<ol style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Define Needs</strong> – <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/select-mobile-app-delivery-platform/" target="_blank">Specify Evaluation Criteria</a></li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Designate Stakeholders</strong> – Assembling the Internal Team</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Develop Use Case</strong> – Designing a Test Project</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Draft Project Plan</strong> – Building a Roadmap</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Next Steps</strong> – Proceeding to the Proof of Concept (kit includes a number of customizable documents to use to:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Evaluate platform vendors</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Determine the scope of a test project</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Strategize on best resource utilization</li>
	<li>Use the results as the starting point for RFI, RFQ and RFPs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Within each step, important considerations and criteria are offered to help IT teams discover all essential requirements needed for an enterprise level platform.
<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom:10px;">Additional Evaluation Criteria for IT Transformation</h4>
Of course within your research and internal examination process, you’ll uncover a number of criteria – some that maybe more valuable than others depending on the breadth and depth of the applications your company seeks to create. For instance, visual modeling may a critical functionality for your IT department to assist you in mapping workflows and business logic. Or maybe the requirements for a platform that allows for immediate, rapid change is more valued within your organization. Whatever the most critical factors you need in a platform – it’s safe to say that a basic overview or demonstration of each functionality is fully represented in the platform you’re considering.

<a  href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RAD-platform-criteria-OutSystems.png" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3607"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3607" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RAD-platform-criteria-OutSystems-1024x816.png" alt="RAD-platform-criteria-OutSystems" width="590" height="470" style="padding-bottom: 10px;"/></a>

I think that this kit, “Rapid Application Delivery Platforms: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/select-mobile-app-delivery-platform/" target="_blank">The Complete Evaluation</a> and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/poc-guide-rad-application-delivery/" target="_blank">Proof of Concept Guide</a>,” offers a solid jump-start to the planning process. It’s chock-full of customizable templates and evaluation criteria that puts enterprise-level IT teams in the right frame of mind. It ensures that you leave no stone unturned, and prepares you for an in-depth Proof of Concept for the right rapid application delivery platform vendor.

It’s free, so why not use it to make the planning process easier?

This stems from an admiration of their aesthetics - reflected in their objects, their pottery, food, gardens – and the amazing quality of their manufactured goods.

But what I admire most is their relentless pursuit of perfection. This is illustrated, go figure, in a quote from Tom Cruise’s movie, The Last Samurai:

“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMT1r9IpIf0#t=1m44s" target="_blank">...from the moment they wake they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue...</a>”<!--more-->

Imagine the pride that our OutSystems engineers felt when Bluememe, our master reseller in Japan, sent us copies of an OutSystems instructional book called, RE:TOOL, freshly released in the Japanese market. This was what was written in the front page:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3638" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/quote.png" alt="quote" width="582" height="84" />

When perfectionists admire what you have crafted it means that you must be doing something right. The care we take in the vision, design and engineering of OutSystems products stems from one of our culture traits that emphasizes that “relentless pursuit of perfection.” That trait is reflected in our book, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/the-small-book/">The Small Book of The Few Big Rules</a>. The seventh Big Rule is the Excel rule:

<img class="alignright wp-image-3706 size-medium" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/diogoh-300x172.jpg" alt="diogoh" width="300" height="172" />The world is changing at a fast pace and generating more information than ever before, so we want our clients to keep up, in order to take the lead and overcome the challenges that present to our organizations everyday.

We believe that in a company daily activity, there is a tremendous amount of information that gets lost in data silos, not being integrated with the corporate systems, and it means that ultimately there is an opportunity to take advantage of that information in order to optimize costs, generate more revenues and discover new insights that can lead to optimization and maximization in areas that never been in our radar.

Deloitte adopted OutSystems as a platform to build engaging business solutions as we recognized it’s ability to accomplish great results with lower costs and great value added to our customers by:
<ul>
	<li>Extend corporate solutions, such as ERP, SRM, CRM or others, in a user/client driven approach, taking advantage of the core and mature processes that these corporate solutions provide;</li>
	<li>Building high complexity solutions (B2B, B2C or B2E) to solve our customers business problems;</li>
	<li>Innovating by creating engaging and inventive solutions to close the gap between the business operation and the enterprise systems;</li>
	<li>Taking advantage of our team greatest asset: it’s multidisciplinary industry know-how and flexible technical skills;</li>
	<li>Delivering easy to use and easy to maintain applications seamlessly integrated with the enterprise systems such as SAP.</li>
</ul>
At Deloitte, we have been building a track record of successful implementations of applications to address our costumers business issues, in a fast, innovative adaptive and engaging way, connecting the operation world with the corporate systems, allowing them to bypass the need of back office teams to produce structured information, as it is coming directly from the field.

Along the way our customers are understanding the value of having motivated people using engaging apps, in order to provide them more actionable information. If this seems to be unreachable as it would be expensive to invest in technology to allow this, today with platforms like OutSystems we can deploy high complexity solutions in a matter of weeks, that can be used in several types of devices without any additional effort needed, or integrated with corporate systems like SAP with great simplicity, reducing the technological complexity, allowing us to focus on our client’s business issues, rather than on technical ones.]]></content:encoded>
