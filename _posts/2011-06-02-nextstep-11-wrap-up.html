<div>On May 19 and 20 we had another great edition of our user conference, the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep</a>. It was an <b>amazing event</b> with the <b>largest ever gathering</b> of our customers, our partners, members of the press, and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a> employees.</div>

<div>During these two days we had keynotes, technical sessions, personal demos, breakfast tables, lunches and coffee breaks. And in all of these <b>everybody shared their work experiences</b>, their expertise using the Agile Platform, their ideas on how to make IT more efficient, and a myriad of other topics were discuss around making business and IT life easier.<!--more--></div>

<div>We had a lot of fun organizing this event, and hope everybody enjoyed it. But this was only possible thanks to our fabulous speakers, to our sponsoring partners, to everyone that helped assemble and organize the venue and, of course, to everybody that attended and turned NextStep into a great show.<b> Thank you very much!</b></div>

<div>We've made a lot of material available online to those that attended and want to review it, and to those that couldn't make it but wished they were there. You can get it at the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/Presentations.aspx">NextStep website</a>.</div>
