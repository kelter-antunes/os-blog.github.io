The demand for enterprise mobility continues to grow with no signs of slowing down. Every customer-centric company has projects underway to transform the digital experience and delight users. Because every customer has a mobile device in their pocket, there has never been a better time to concentrate IT efforts on creating apps with mobile context and value.<!--more-->

With the market for mobile application development still maturing, the plethora of tools available to help address your enterprise app portfolio needs can be overwhelming. So, we took some time to really understand what tools are available, what categories they fall into, what stage of the development cycle they address, and what functions they perform.

The resulting reference architecture matrix (below) shows that you'll need a complex chain of interwoven point solutions to achieve enterprise mobility. It also illustrates how a rapid app delivery approach can offer dramatic speed improvements with streamlined full-lifecycle simplicity.

We also took this reference matrix one step further and built a complete architecture reference guide to help our community gain a better understanding of the mobile landscape. I invite you to take a look at our matrix and <a title="Navigating the Mobile App Dev Landscape" href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/mobile-app-dev-landscape" target="_blank">download the full eBook</a> to see all the options available for your development organization.
