<div>Like all good things, Justin James' <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/outsystems-agile-platform-the-ide-of-my-dreams/" target="_blank">Developer Diary</a> series has finally come to an end - a happy one at that!  Justin successfully used the Agile Platform to bring his <a href="http://ratcatcher.titaniumcrowbar.com/" target="_blank">Rat Catcher</a> application from idea to fully-fledged application.  During the last few months he learned the platform, overcame the challenges of scarce resources, infrastructure, etc to deliver his application.<!--more--></div>

<div>In his <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/wrapping-up-my-outsystems-agile-platform-application-project/" target="_blank">final entry</a>, Justin explains how he used the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> to retrofit some aspects of his application, specifically moving his layout from tables to CSS.  He also gives us his thoughts around the new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/agile-platform-5.1-release/">Agile Platform 5.1</a> as well as the lessons he learned using our platform.</div>
