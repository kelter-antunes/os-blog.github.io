<div>A while back we conducted a productivity study with our customers, called <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/company/news/2010/outbynumbers-agile-platform-efficiency/">OutByNumbers</a>, to see how much more productive they were using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The numbers for this study showed that all of our customers were experiencing great productivity gains.  However,  as you might have guessed,<b> there were some projects that performed better than others</b>.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="gauge icon.png" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gauge%20icon1.png" />This didn't come as a surprise, but we decided to dig deeper and talk a bit with the people involved to see if we could identify what made one project go faster than another.  We asked them what were the major factors that increased their overall project productivity, and here are the top answers we got:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><b>Small teams, highly experienced in the technology</b></li>
	<li><b>Teams that frequently interact with the business</b> and with extensive business knowledge</li>
	<li><b>A good, straightforward application architecture</b>, as opposed to complex or excessively layered architectures</li>
	<li><b>Frequent moves to production</b>, using a very iterative approach</li>
	<li><b>Applications with less demanding user interfaces</b>, like back-offices, usually lead to higher levels of productivity</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The first four factors are very much in synch with what Agile methodologies advocate, and its good to see Agile delivering on its promise.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But what really caught my attention was that last bullet. Crafting a top-notch, super usable interface is something that seems to take a lot of effort. Why is it so, and how can we improve this? Surely something to write about in a future blog post!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Do you agree with these 5 factors? Are there other major productivity boosters you'd like to share?</div>
