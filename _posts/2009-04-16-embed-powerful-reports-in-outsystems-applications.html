<div>Afonso Metello, founder and managing partner at <a href="http://www.epopeia.pt/">Epopeia</a>, kicked off his presentation by showing a video of the Report Studio, the tool that allows users to easily design their reports in the Agile Reporting Services solution.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 20px auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="epopeia.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/epopeia2.jpg" width="520" height="253" /></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Agile Reporting Services is a unified business reporting solution that covers the full report life-cycle, and it is seamlessly integrated with the OutSystems Agile Platform. This solution tackles a series of challenges other tools fail to address, in particular:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Fast change</li>
<li>Easy to use for non-tech users</li>
<li>Impact analysis (i.e. understand the exact consequences of publishing a report)</li>
<li>Self heal (i.e. adapt to changes in the underlying model)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Afonso explained how the Agile Reporting Services totally integrates with the Agile Platform, enabling users to design, deliver and manage reports in a environment familiar to Â OutSystems users. He also showed some screen shots of an OutSystems application that included report and charting widgets provided by Epopeia's solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During Q&amp;A, Afonso stressed that all reports are built on top of the data made available by the OutSystems platform. This means that - on top of built-to-change capabilities - the reports will also support easy staging from development to production.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Agile Reporting Services solution is about to go to beta in some selected customers, and is currently undergoing OutSystems Certification.</div>
