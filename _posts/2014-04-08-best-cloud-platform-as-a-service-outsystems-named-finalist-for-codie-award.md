Last week, OutSystems was selected as a finalist for the prestigious <a title="CODiE" href="http://www.siia.net/codies/2014/finalists.asp" target="_blank">2014 SIIA CODiE Awards</a>. We placed in its <strong>Best Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> category along with several other firms, including Red Hat and NetSuite.<!--more-->
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/codie-2014.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1878"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1878" style="padding: 20px;" alt="codie-2014" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/codie-2014.png" width="316" height="36" /></a>We’re honored by this nomination and recognition. A tremendous amount of effort and ingenuity has gone into developing OutSystems Platform. Our team is among the most dedicated in the PaaS market today, working with and listening to our 350+ enterprise customers so we can continually deliver something truly remarkable - a solution that empowers them to create, deploy and manage limitless mobile and web applications without traditional friction points such as infrastructure or hand-coding. The Platform is available in the cloud, on-premises, or as a hybrid environment.</p>
<strong>But in a crowded market with multiple vendors selling wildly different solutions, what sets us apart?</strong>

Well for starters, instead of simply moving hand-coding to the cloud, with OutSystems, businesses can strap a rocket to the productivity of their application efforts. <strong>How?</strong> By using a visual design and development metaphor to create simple to complex applications that are as easy to make and release as they are to modify, giving them the freedom to innovate and break the shackles of inescapable change backlogs.

We do all of this while protecting customers from lock-in, meaning that at any point they can detach from OutSystems and take their Platform-generated standard Java or .NET applications and run them on unaltered stacks.

The finalists in our category have powerful use cases for their platforms. Some go vertical, specializing in certain industries, and that’s great… if that is a fit for your long-term needs. But for the organization that wants an open, high-productivity application platform that makes it easy to create, deploy and manage enterprise mobile and web applications, OutSystems offers more value than any other solution on the market.
