excerpt: OutSystems app wizard, Pedro Queirós, recently participated in a City of
  Atlanta hackathon - and won! This blog post is a diary of his “Govathon” journey,
  complete with videos. Pedro describes step by step how he built a texting app, connected
  it to a government database, and delivered a live app with real data integration
  in just 24 hours.

<p>I like hackathons. And one of the main reasons I like them is the limited time period the organizers enforce. I take particular satisfaction in delivering production quality and relatively large apps in less than 24 hours. I can do this because a large portion of the work is done with the help of a RAD tool - OutSystems Platform.<!--more--></p>
<p>This hackathon was called “Govathon.” The City of Atlanta brought together government officials with problems and developers that could craft solutions to these problems. I was one of these developers. Following is my timeline with some short videos showing how I built the app.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 7:00 pm </span>-- Getting started</h4>
<p>The organizers of <a href="http://govathon.com/" target="_blank">Govathon</a> took 30 minutes to present their challenges to the nine teams. Teams assembled themselves around one or several similar ideas. I wanted to pick a project that was useful and would have a chance of being used by the city of Atlanta, and I got intrigued by what Angela Patrick from the building permits office had to say.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 8:30 pm </span>-- A mobile app to access government data</h4>
<p>Solving the problem Angela defined would lead to better customer service. People typically call the office to get an updated status on their building permits. There is a web portal but users could not find it easily and were often working at remote locations during the day. Angela wanted a mobile app so people could check their status without having to call the office.<br />
OutSystems has a <a title="OutSystems Platform" href="http://www.outsystems.com/get-started/">fully functional version of their platform in the cloud that is great for personal projects</a>. It is free forever and as long as you don’t need enterprise grade features it is more than enough. I registered and had my development environment up and running in minutes.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 9:00 pm </span>-- Integrating with Excel</h4>
<p><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I was given an Excel document with the 60,000 building permits from the last few years, and I quickly created a database inside OutSystems Platform that could hold all the data.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wk3bcf3skr" name="wistia_embed" width="100%" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 9:45 pm </span>-- The first mobile UI</h4>
<p><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Based on the data, I quickly scaffolded an initial prototype of the user interface using the standard ‘London theme’ that comes with OutSystems Platform.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nokjxe96sf" name="wistia_embed" width="100%" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Friday, 10:30 pm </span>-- Going home to sleep</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2357" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sleeping1.png" alt="sleeping" width="500" height="173" /></p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 8:30 am </span>-- <span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Multichannel apps: Developing a text interface with Twilio</span></h4>
<p>While getting dressed, I thought about the real-use scenario of this app. Adoption rates of mobile apps are ridiculously low if the real usage scenario is misunderstood. I wondered if a texting interface to query the database would yield better adoption rates. <a href="http://www.twilio.com" target="_blank">Twilio</a> to the rescue!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2358 size-full aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/govathon-screenshot-mobile-device-e14240869589491.jpg" alt="govathon-screenshot-mobile device" width="590" height="361" /> Twilio is a telephony service, that among other things, enables apps to send and receive text messages. I integrated Twilio with my app using the REST capabilities of OutSystems Platform.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 9:30 am </span>-- Twilio integration using a service callback</h4>
<p><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This sophisticated integration was made simple with OutSystems Platform. I created a Twilio account, which gives me a phone number. Any text message sent to that phone number generates a callback into my app. Check out how fast I did it.</span></p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 10:00 am </span>-- Publishing and running the app</h4>
<p><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This is how it works. Send a text message (SMS) to the phone number, then the app fetches the data from the database and sends the result back by text.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uqbm2hylxm" name="wistia_embed" width="590" height="332" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script></p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 10:30 am </span>-- Live integration with the permit database service</h4>
<p><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">I was done. I headed down to Atlanta Workforce Development headquarters and had some time before I was to demo and present my app at 3:00. But I could not resist some enhancements! The permit database is supported by <a href="http://www.accela.com" target="_blank">Accela</a>, and they have a great <a href="https://developer.accela.com/" target="_blank">public REST API</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd" target="_blank">Mark Headd</a> was nice enough to send me a couple of request/response examples that I fed into OutSystems Platform. Ten minutes later, I was able to connect my texting app to the live data of building permits of Atlanta.</span></p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">Saturday, 3:00 pm </span>-- Winning!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Govathon-1st-Place1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2381"><img class="padding-right:20px alignleft wp-image-2381 size-thumbnail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Govathon-1st-Place-150x1501.jpg" alt="Govathon-1st-Place" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/eklementich" target="_blank">Eloisa Klementich</a>, co-founder of Govathon, announced the winners. Citing innovation and growth as a primary objective of the City, she was pleased to name my Building Permitting app as the winner of the fourth annual Govathon!</p>
<p>Now residents and businesses can check the status of their building permit applications in real time!</p>

<p>RAD platforms work. OutSystems Platform allowed me to deliver a working SMS app with live integration in less than 24 hours - with some sleep included :)</p>
