<p>Hugo Sousa, IT Director of <a href="http://www.turismodeportugal.pt/">Turismo de Portugal</a>, started out by sharing with the audience his commitment to the business goals of Turismo de Portugal. For that, he showed us his project goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure and get 90% satisfaction</li>
<li>People are all that matters</li>
<li>Do IT better</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This is a very important change in IT, where usually the metrics are measured in bandwidth and server uptime!</p>

<p>Hugo pointed out that to do this IT Governance was a <i>must</i>. But because the rules can change and need to be adapted, Hugo stated that what he really needed was Agile IT Governance. After looking at several pre-packaged solutions, Turismo de Portugal picked OutSystems because it was the technology that could provide the necessary flexibility to implement IT rules in a simple and agile way.</p>
<p>By using OutSystems technology and implementing with <a href="http://www.inov.pt/">INOV</a> a centralized help desk system, Turismo de Portugal not only surpassed the 90% satisfaction mark, but was also able to gather data on the submitted incidents and have real time visibility on SLAs and satisfaction status.</p>
<p>Hugo highlighted 3 reasons why Turismo de Portugal picked OutSystems:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you need is what you get</li>
<li>Change is the only constant</li>
<li>Technology is not the most important thing. People are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turismo de Portugal plans to continue using OutSystems to expand their solution to support change management and financial management, and also other important projects not only related to Service-Desk (ITIL).</p>
