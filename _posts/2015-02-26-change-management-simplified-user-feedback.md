<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">In a never-ending attempt to reduce the amount of time it takes to get <a title="changes incorporated into apps" href="http://www.outsystems.com/platform/iterate-rapidly/">changes incorporated into apps</a>, OutSystems has up-leveled your ability to properly capture context and user feedback directly - across all devices.</p>
<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/outsystems-feedback-app.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-2558"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2558" src="http://www.outsystems.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/outsystems-feedback-app.jpg" alt="outsystems-feedback-app" width="590" height="423" /></a>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;">Whether it be a QA engineer that spots something that doesn't quite look right or a business user that just wants that OneMoreThingâ„¢, the days of crude screenshots, emails, spreadsheets, and steaming abyss of unfindable requests are over. Use your tablet to let your development team know exactly what you want. Draw on the screen. Add a voice note ("I would love to see a graph here that shows the relative efficiency of my different service techs"), or just type something in. Everything the user sees and annotates gets balled up into a nice user story that developers can review in a beautiful interface that also allows them to jump directly to the screen in question and begin implementing the change. Ridiculously efficient and effective!<!--more--></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 15px;">Yes, OutSystems customers have been able to do this for quite some time, but we've recently streamlined and extended it across not just web, but all devices. Not simply satisfied using a web metaphor on mobile, we've extended it to take advantage of the capabilities and likely workflow of each device at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">We hope you enjoy this update and that you use it to great effect further crushing cycle time. Want a sneak peek? Here's a quick video:</p>
