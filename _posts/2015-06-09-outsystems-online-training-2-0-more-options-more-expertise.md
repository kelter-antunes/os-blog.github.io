In the two years since we launched our free online training page, we’ve been paying attention to feedback from our developers and community members. So we've been working behind the scenes to enhance the online training experience and make it even easier to learn OutSystems Platform.

Here’s what’s new...<!--more-->
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Different Training Offers for Different Needs</h3>
Getting up to speed fast with a new technology is critically important. For this reason, we have three different ways you can start learning with OutSystems Platform:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Online Training</b>: Developers can get started right away and leverage the OutSystems community to share and learn. Online training is free.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>New! Online Class</b>: In this two-week class, developers can engage in a self-paced, instructor-assisted course. Online classes are free.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Developer Boot Camp</b>: An intensive one-week, on-site training experience where developers learn through hands-on training.</li>
</ul>
Because we care about the OutSystems community and are proud of it, we improved the OutSystems online training experience. This way you can access awesome training materials when you need them, where you need them. And for free!
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Introducing Multiple Courses</h3>
We know how important it is to have content that caters to novice OutSystems developers, but also helps you progress and become an expert. That's why we've updated our online course curriculum.

The online training now features three courses:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>OutSystems in an Hour</b>: Create a mobile contacts app, and get the hang of OutSystems IDE.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Development Fundamentals:</b> Learn the OutSystems Platform language fundamentals while building another app from scratch.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><b>Mastering OutSystems:</b> Find a wide range of advanced training materials, like CSS, Javascript, architecture and integrations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Easy-to-Search Videos With Transcripts</h3>
You've asked for it, and we listened! Everybody was having trouble searching certain topics that were hidden inside the videos. With transcripts, you no longer need to watch the whole video to find the topic that interests you. Just jump directly to it!

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Asking Questions Made Easy</h3>
We made it super easy to ask questions. You no longer need to scroll down to the end of the discussion thread to ask a question.

And now you can even reference a specific time frame when asking questions.

So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/learn/" target="_blank">Visit the training page</a>.

This is only the beginning.  You can expect more changes in the months to come, as we're planning to add more training materials, and improve the ones that are available right now. We're also working on new features for the training pages that we think you'll enjoy.

We hope you're enjoying your OutSystems experience!
