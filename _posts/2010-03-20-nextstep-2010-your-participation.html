<p>This year's conference will focus on '<b>Addressing the last inefficient industry of the 21st century - IT</b>'. We hope you can join us in Lisbon for the event where you will have the opportunity to network with the whole OutSystems community, last year we had over 450 people registered to the event!  But if you can't make the trip to Portugal, don't worry - you can still stay on top of what's happening at NextStep by visiting the About Agility blog before, during and after the conference.</p>
