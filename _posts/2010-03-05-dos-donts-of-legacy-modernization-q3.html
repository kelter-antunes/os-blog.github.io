<p>As a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2010/03/dos-donts-of-legacy-modernization-part-2.html">previous post</a>; here is the third and final interview question from our conversation with <a href="http://lwsoa.blogspot.com/">Lawrence Wilkes</a>, Director and Principal Consultant with <a href="http://www.everware-cbdi.com/">Everware-CBDi</a>, on how IT departments are addressing their legacy systems:</p>
<p><b>Q.3 What are the top three mistakes people make when addressing their legacy?<!--more--></b></p>
<p><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="LW.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/LW2.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></p>
<p><b>LW: </b>I might have hoped that post Y2K, organizations would have more actively sought to avoid building yet more legacy systems. However, time and again we see organizations doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Creating another legacy.</b> They fail to understand why they have legacy systems in the first place, and just rush into creating another one. They don't understand the requirement for on-going change, nor does the business encourage them to think about it. This could be due to:Â  a lack of process - i.e. they don't understand how to facilitate change at each stage of the life-cycle; or, stakeholders unwillingness or inability to express requirements for change.</li>
<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b>Not designing for agility.</b>Agility isn't just a process - as in agile development - agility is also an analysis and design requirement. Ensuring a new solution is better able to respond to change than the legacy systems it is replacing requires appropriate techniques throughout the life cycle. It isn't just a matter of creating a more agile implementation built with finer-grained components and services, but also understanding the business's requirements for agility and identifying those components and services in a way that aligns with that. Conversely, you don't need to over-compensate and waste time providing too much agility where it is not needed - although, that is always going to be difficult to predict...</li>
<li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b>Not cleanly separating the legacy from the new solution.</b> The two become entwined storing up an even bigger legacy problem for the future. For example, a proper service architecture is not developed that is truly independent of the legacy systems, and so the new solution remains tightly coupled to the legacy. Even though they may use loosely coupled technology such as web services, their content and behavior is just a direct reflection of the legacy system.</li>
</ol>
