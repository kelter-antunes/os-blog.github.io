<p>We were all very excited to hear one of our customers, Max Rayner, speak at the recent <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/index.jsp?eid=431&amp;id=296">ALM Expo</a> on how he and his team built and delivered the <b><a href="http://www.fly.com/">www.fly.com</a> </b>system using an agile approach. If you're not familiar with it, this is an internet application that's openly available and was built using <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-methodology">Agile methodologies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">SCRUM</a> techniques and an <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">Agile ALM toolset</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="MAX_RAYNER_s.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MAX_RAYNER_s2.jpg" width="94" height="113" />Max is the CTO of <a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/">Travelzoo</a> - a travel publisher with 18 million subscribers and fly.com is an online app that helps you find the exact match to your air travel needs. During the webcast Max discussed the problem space, their agile approach, the innovative metasearch engine, how they managed a distributed team, challenges, key learnings and reasons for their success.<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" alt="travelzoo agile approach.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/travelzoo%20agile%20approach1.jpg" width="456" height="337" /></span>With all that said, I can't really do the webcast justice in this blog as there was SO much great information shared - but you can:</p>
<p>1) download the <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/res/webcast%20presentation%20slides.pdf" target="_blank">webcast presentation slides.pdf</a></span> and listen to the podcast <object width="200" height="20" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /><param name="src" value="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/player_mp3.swf" /><param name="flashvars" value="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /><embed width="200" height="20" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/player_mp3.swf" flashvars="mp3=http%3A//events.unisfair.com/mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3" /> <!--more--></object></p>
<p>2) view the <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/index.jsp?eid=431&amp;id=296">full recording of the webcast here</a> (unfortunately, you will need to register but its free and painless.)</p>
<p>3) or, you can download the <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/SP2_download.jsp?mp3/ec_431/431_296.mp3_unisfairId=1663235772">podcast of the presentation here</a> and listen in your own time.</p>
<p>BTW, the recordings include a great Q&amp;A session that I would highly recommend listening to!  Here are some stats Max shared on the fly.com agile project:</p>
<div><b>Duration </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Expected: 28 weeks  Actual: 32 weeks</li>
<li>Number of Sprints: 14 (including a tuning sprint,) Number of Demos: 12</li>
<li>250 change requests (using Agile Platform Embedded Change Technology)</li>
<li>4 week tuning sprint &amp; 4 versions released during tuning</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Team</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Business Sponsor: Chief Technology Officer</li>
<li>1 Engagement Manager, 1 Delivery Manager, 3-5 Developers &amp; 1 QA</li>
<li>7 Key Users</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technology</b></p>
<ul>
<li>OutSystems Agile Platform used for: requirements gathering, design, integration, component assembly, version control &amp; configuration management, deployment &amp; performance management</li>
<li>Over 20 integrations w/ databases, third party systems etc</li>
<li>.NET environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>I believe this case study to be a great testament to the Agile development approach; the project achievements speak for themselves</b>:</p>
<p><b>1. </b>Fly.com is able to handle a sustained load of 40,000 searches per hour with 99.8% availability<i></i></p>
<p><b>2. </b>Fly.com functionality delivered with less cost &amp; faster than competitive solutions</p>
<p><b>3. </b>6 months to deliver working system that was stress tested, and then new features added to meet &amp; beat the competition</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Less than 1 year to develop &amp; release what competitors had taken 2+ years to achieve</p>
<p><b>5. </b>Compares prices from hundreds of airlines &amp; online travel sites with just one user search.  Integration of 12+ distinct information providers in real-time, aggregating all the data received, stored &amp; made available asynchronously</p>
<p><b>6. </b>Links to hundreds of external sites with over 30 types of parameter formatting &amp; integration methods.<br />

What were your major take-away's' from Max's webcast?  Have you come across other case studies of major applications that have been built with Agile methods?  Are these Agile case studies useful to you and should we publish more here?</i></p>
