<div>It's October, which means it's time for another <a href="http://www.idc.pt/events/eventos_2010-10-20.jsp">IDC Directions</a> in Portugal. Keeping last years' tradition, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> sponsored this event and sent a team of ambassadors to talk to some of the key players in the Portuguese IT industry.<!--more--></div>

<div>Although the current economic downturn was part of the agenda, the feeling around the event was extremely positive. The opening keynote by Cort Isernhagen did a great job of putting the minds of everyone on  the need to make IT not only more efficient, but also more effective!</div>
<div></div>
<div>This was very much in line with what our own Mike Jones had prepared for his keynote.  His presentation was focused on "<b>The IT Efficiency Imperative</b>", and highlighted the fact that tough economic times tend to present innovative companies with the opportunities to react to new market conditions and chase that 'illusive' new pot of gold.</div>

<div>In <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/miwjones/the-it-efficiency-imperative">his presentation</a> he set out four key concepts that ITs need to take into consideration to be not only efficient, but also effective in <b>helping the business innovate</b>.  The presentation was based on Geoffrey Moore's core/context model, and to help people visualize the concept, we printed it out on some paper napkins!  These were a huge success with everyone that visited the OutSystems stand as they listened to our presentations, drank coffee and ate OutSystems donuts!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Aside from the napkins, there was a lot more activity on our stand. On day one, we handed two <b>Agility Awards</b> to DGAL for a couple of projects: <a href="http://www.portalautarquico.pt/portalautarquico/">Portal Autárquico</a>, and the SIIAL and SIGE projects. On the second day, it was <a href="http://www.hovione.com/">Hovione</a>'s turn to receive an Agility Award for their <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/Hovione/Global%20Performance%20System/">Global Performance System</a> project, implemented by <a href="http://www.noesis.pt/">Noesis</a>. We also had a demo of <a href="http://www.iberomail.com/">IberoMail</a>'s solution on our booth, performed by <a href="http://www.normatica.pt/">Normatica</a>. Thank you all for coming and<b> congratulations on the projects and awards!</b></div>
