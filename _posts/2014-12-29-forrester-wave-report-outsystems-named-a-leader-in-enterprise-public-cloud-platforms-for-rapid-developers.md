The Rapid Application Delivery (RAD) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) markets are littered with solutions that attempt to solve various challenges application development and delivery (AD&amp;D) organizations face today.

So when Forrester recently released their Wave report on Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms, we were pleased to read their advice on navigating this space and choosing an appropriate solution.

The analyst firm highlights the value of PaaS as it applies to three different use cases or developer types. We at OutSystems are proud to have been recognized as a Leader for rapid development.

<div style="margin-left: 30px;"><i>"Within the CIO’s domain, public cloud platforms empower AD&amp;D pros with frameworks, tools, and consoles that speed creation, deployment, and ongoing updates. Select the right platform and AD&amp;D pros will be highly productive."</i></div>
&nbsp;

The trick is identifying the right platform. Forrester advises that organizations choose a platform based on their developers and their needs.

The Forrester Wave report defines three types of developers. The primary difference between them is the amount of resource control that they want or need.

According to Forrester:
<ul>
	<li><i>Rapid developers want high productivity, not resource details.</i></li>
	<li><i>Coders want to program, not manage infrastructure.</i></li>
	<li><i>DevOps pros want configuration control when they need it.</i></li>
</ul>
We were pleased to see that Forrester identifies OutSystems as a Leader for rapid developers.

OutSystems Platform provides a no- or low-code approach to developing mobile and web apps once and deploying them to a variety of devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, web). In addition, DevOps principles like continuous integration and delivery along with application performance management are built into the Platform to support the entire application lifecycle. The Platform is designed to help organizations rapidly build and deploy quality apps, even if the organization has a skills gap. As Forrester puts it, “OutSystems includes extensive visual, declarative development and delivery tools, prebuilt applications and application components, support for both web and mobile application creation, and rich continuous delivery and application life-cycle management tools.”
