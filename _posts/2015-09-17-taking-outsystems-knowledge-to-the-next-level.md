As part of our continued growth, OutSystems has prioritized delivering better ways to help our customers and partners be successful. Our new <a href="http://success.outsystems.com/support/" target="_blank">Public support knowledge base</a> is a central part of this strategy and further expands our world-class enterprise support and friendly <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/forums/" target="_blank">Community</a> to make sure no question goes unanswered.<!--more-->

We know getting started with a new technology can be difficult. In this first release, we focused on providing guidance, immediate solutions, and information for common support questions around installation, licensing, and troubleshooting. Weâ€™ve also made it much easier to get in touch with OutSystems Support team.

In the next few months, we will regularly add valuable content around other areas like learning and evaluating the Platform, as well as ensuring that all customers can enjoy a hassle-free start to their OutSystems Platform usage. We will also be working on new ways to help support our growing development community with new training resources.
