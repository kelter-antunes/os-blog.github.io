<div>Dear Santa,</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've been a good girl in the last few years, providing ITs all across the world the ability to have a productivity they could never imagine. I help all kinds of developers, from juniors to seniors, to implement large and robust web applications in a fraction of the time they would take if using traditional frameworks.<!--more--></div>

<div>But I miss something... I miss a fast way to reach those developers that have not heard of me before. I miss a good way to let them know how valuable I am. Every time I want to introduce myself to someone I always need to take my friends SQL Server, IIS and MSMQ with me, turning that first introduction into a very formal commitment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This Xmas I would like to be tried by those developers much more easily. I would really like you to bring me a cloud trial service. That way I would only send them Service Studio, my IDE, to show them all the awesome things I can provide. It would really be fun if they could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">play around in my cloud sandbox</span> for a while.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh, and meanwhile, I could give them an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging learning experience</span>, with game-like tutorials that go straight to the point, contextually helping them whenever they need to know more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I bet all of this would really bring my users closer to me. And that would make me an even better girl.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: right;">Thank you Santa. Hope you drop by this December.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">The Agile Platform</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top: 30px;">Guess what... The R&amp;D team pulled up their sleeves and made sure that Santa would come sooner this year!</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Version 5.1.1</b> was released as a technical preview on Dec 2, and you are all invited to <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download/">try it out</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The entire team made such a fantastic job in focusing on the most relevant user stories, in order to deliver a valuable release in a much shorter amount of time, that in the end we got ourselves a small party... And we even got a new mug!</div>
