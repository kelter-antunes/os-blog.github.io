<p><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/04/4-trends-driving-it-as-a-source-of-competitive-advantage.html">Paulo Rosado said that Trend #1 is that Agile Adoption</a> <i>is accelerating </i>- and this conference certainly seems to be proof of this - with all the exceptional sessions on Agile development and delivery experiences, case studies and tips and tricks!  We will be posting information on how you can access the presentation slides in the near future - in the meantime you can read our <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">blog entries on each session</a> in this blog.</p>
