<p>OutSystems' own VP Marketing, Mike Jones, recently wrote an article in <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/index.jhtml">Dr. Dobb's</a> on the <a href="http://bit.ly/9BEVd9">"death" of custom applications </a>in theenterprise world - and it seems to have caused a bit of a debate - both in comments on the article and in an off-shoot blog post on the same subject.</p>

<p>The supposed killer?  Software packages.  But are custom apps really dead? Mike's take is that while software packages were once considered the silver bullet of enterprise IT, this is no longer the case.  Agile development practice, coupled with a strong delivery platform, has pushed custom development back on par with off-the-shelf solutions and, in some cases, has made custom apps a better choice than their boxed counterparts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Mike's <a href="http://bit.ly/9BEVd9">original article in Dr. Dobbs</a> and the reader comments.</li>
<li>Also, check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/a7BsWn">blog post</a> by <i>Ann All of IT Business Edge</i>, and the question she poses; "will Agile development bring back custom software?"</li>
</ul>
<p>What's your experience with custom applications versus packaged software?  Do you agree with Mike? Join the conversation!</p>
