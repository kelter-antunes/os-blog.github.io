<p>I got to listen to a replay of the "CIO Power Panel" from <a title="NextStep" href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/" target="_blank">NextStep 2012</a>Â recently, and found a gold nugget around the role of Business Analysts in an Agile development approach.<!--more--><a title="Click here to watch the video" href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/it-strategy/cio-power-panel/"><img class="mt-image-right alignright" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px;" alt="CIO Power Panel" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video-background-blog-thumb12.png" width="274" height="210" /></a> The panel was moderated by <a title="OutSystems" href="http://www.outsystems.com">OutSystems</a> CEO Paulo Rosado and had CxOs from four different companies chiming in on how agile works in their shops and the impact of business analysts on their processes.</p>
<p>From 'Catarinas' to huge project failures, this was a colorful debate. So if you are wondering how to make agile work in your enterprise application development process, take 15 minutes to listen to this snippet from the discussion. You can hear the 15 minute segment <a title="CIO Power Panel" href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/it-strategy/cio-power-panel/">here</a>.</p>
