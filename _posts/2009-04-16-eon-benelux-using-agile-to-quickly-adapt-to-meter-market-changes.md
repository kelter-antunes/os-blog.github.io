Next up at NextStep - Marteijn Mout who is the project managers of the<b> 'New meter market model' </b>at E.ON Benelux. E.ON is one of Europe's largest Energy providers with over 30 million customers in 30 countries.Â  E.ON Benelux has around 270,000 customers and they have been a customer of OutSystems since 2004.<!--more-->

He shared a great deal of information about how E.ON developed their solution using Agile and working with OutSystems, SAP and other partners.</div>
Describing the team's experience of using OutSystems Agile approach he told us that:
<ul>
	<li>They started with 5 iterations (sprints), with a period length of 2 weeks</li>
	<li>Sprint 6 was added to address new change requests</li>
	<li>Weekly progress reports with 2 demo's after every sprint and 2 week testing periods after demos</li>
	<li>Change Management requests were registered in OutSystems Agile Network (OAN), ECT and assumptions documented</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
Key challenges that the experienced:
<ul>
	<li>They were initially skeptical of the OutSystems size and scope estimate for the project - but happy that the results were delivered as expected.</li>
	<li>Intensive collaboration - Marteijn quipped that "I'm not sure how many emails I received from and sent to the OutSystems team - but there were a LOT. It wasn't bad - but was an indication of the degree of collaboration!"</li>
	<li>"We had some initial challenges on combining Waterfall and Agile methods - especially in planning - we were lucky that OutSystems' approach was flexible on that front, and we were able to combine planning into a single planning/test plan."</li>
	<li>The greatest issue was they found was the temptation to keep adding new requirements - and it was important to keep that reigned in where possible.</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
<b>End results of the project were a success! </b>
<ul>
	<li>The Customer Portal and underlying SMDR "engine" meet all requirements and more!</li>
	<li>OutSystems were a good sparring partner for architectural and functional matters</li>
	<li>OutSystems were flexible as promised (planning/adaptability)</li>
	<li>Communication lines efficient, effective and sound - even with a LOT of emails ;)</li>
	<li>Realistic planning/sizing and no budget overruns</li>
	<li>The Agile approach and technology is a big success factor for the project!</li>
</ul>&nbsp;
<i>How are you coping with the amount of inter-team communications that's required by Agile - what tools are you using?</i>
