<p>The adoption of platform as a service (PaaS) has increased dramatically over the past 12 months, and is now one of the fastest growing areas of all cloud computing services. By 2016, Gartner estimates that every organization will run some or all of its business software on public or private PaaS, driving spending up to $2.9 billion. IDC puts 2017 spending at more than $14 billion. Whatever analyst statistics are used to gauge the growth and uptake of PaaS, there is no doubt that adoption is set to significantly increase in 2014. Why?<!--more--></p>
<p>Done well, this type of approach allows IT organizations to embrace blinding speed and efficiency in how they design, develop, deploy, and manage their application portfolio. Add in a maturing market and you can start to see why organizations are seeking out PaaS options.</p>
<p>It is well documented that PaaS offerings facilitate the deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software stacks. However, the real benefits extend way beyond the low initial start-up costs as PaaS can really enhance the overall development process. Here are five ways that PaaS does this:</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>1. Faster access to infrastructure</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">In a non-PaaS environment, the time to provision machines can sometimes take up to three months, which delays ROI and kills business agility. PaaS is the fastest way to build and deploy enterprise applications, enabling organizations to gets results in days, supercharging the application development environment.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>2. Greater scalability</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Sometimes physical scalability (compute, storage, memory) and logical scalability (load balancers, databases, middleware, front-end) are difficult to provision in a traditional datacenter set up. PaaS automates and accelerates this process to enable real elasticity and scalability.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>3. Faster time to release and iterate</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Automating the activities outside of design and development yields can significantly speed up software release cycles. This, coupled with reducing developer cycle time from requirement to release, is a powerful productivity multiplier. PaaS solutions remove otherwise oppressive but common concerns like versioning, multi-stage promotion, feedback capture, and performance instrumentation. This enables developers, IT, and business users to collaborate and iterate with impressive quality and speed.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>4. Higher availability</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Cloud enables developers to easily create solutions with high availability, which are typically difficult to provision and design on-premises. PaaS is also the perfect way for application developers to respond to new service and change requests from the business without breaking the bank.</p>
<h4 style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>5. Faster time to value</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">With reliable automation and abstraction built into many PaaS solutions, IT staff members are released from time-consuming tasks allowing them to focus on high-value activities. Developers, unencumbered by the tasks they werenâ€™t happy doing, are more motivated, creative and fast. Business users, now thrilled with newfound agility, are happier and more engaged with the process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Different PaaS offerings will be better suited to different enterprise requirements. Therefore, before going down the PaaS route, organizations really need to understand what is driving them to the cloud; otherwise the benefits realized might not meet expectations.</p>

<p>That said, there is no doubt that it makes more and more sense for enterprises to investigate the advantages of using PaaS in 2014.</p>
