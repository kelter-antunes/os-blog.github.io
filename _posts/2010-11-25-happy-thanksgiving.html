<p><b>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</b></p>
<div></div>
<div>I know, I know... Today is Thanksgiving in America only, but I still wanted to share it with all our followers from around the world. After all, it's the perfect opportunity to say "thank you" to everyone that has supported OutSystems throughout the years.<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<p><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" alt="turkey.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/turkey2.png" width="133" height="160" /></p>
<div>Coming up with everyone that helped OutSystems is nearly impossible, so this list is bound to be incomplete... So, if I missed anyone, fell free to add your own "thank you" note on the comments. And don't be shy about adding yourself!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Without further ado, here's my own <b>incomplete gratitude list:</b></div>
