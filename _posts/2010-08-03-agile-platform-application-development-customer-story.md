At OutSystems, we love our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform#What+is+the+Agile+Platform">product</a>. We honestly believe that it is something that truly makes the lives of IT people better. Which, in turn, has made <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies">our customers</a> more successful. We've seen it work over and over and we try and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Network/ViewFreeContent.aspx?FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Network/Home/Help%20us%20Spread%20the%20Word">tell everyone</a> we can about it, but it sometimes sounds too good to be true. However, the <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/programming-and-development/?p=1216">word is spreading</a> among the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/Forum_View.aspx?ForumName=Technology+%26+Integration&amp;ForumId=25">developers</a> and we're seeing more and more people<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download"> try it</a> out for themselves.   And we love that.<!--more-->

<b>What we love even more</b> is when we hear from you, our customers, about how much you love the Agile Platform too. This note is from one such customer who I was emailing with about being a reference for an upcoming press launch - and I just feel compelled to share it.

I love it... I wish I had discovered OutSystems years ago...

Let me give you a little background...

I was in the midst of creating the current application we are working on (in a competing tool,) when it came across my desk that I needed to create another system for our new online school that's scheduled to open in the Fall. Well, I needed to make this one happen fast, and it would have taken far too long to create in the existing tool.  So, I started searching the web for a faster way. I downloaded and tried two other products before I found OutSystems - both were completely unsatisfactory. They did not give me full control. Then, after probably another month, I stumbled across the OutSystems web page, and I'm very happy to have found it. With the Agile Platform I get complete control over the application, and can see and work with the code visually.  I was able to create a live application for the online school in no time.  The Agile Platform is so good that after creating the application for the online school, I wanted to scrap my current application for our brick and mortar schools and immediately started development for our brick and mortar application on the OutSystems platform.  The speed and ease of programming is what it's all about.

So, I am glad to tell anyone about OutSystems. I think its a great company, great people, great platform.

Thanks

If you don't believe us - believe Dan. We think the Agile Platform is truly a better way to build, change and manage your web business applications.

OK, getting off my soapbox now and on with the day ;)

Have you used the Agile Platform? What do you think of it?
