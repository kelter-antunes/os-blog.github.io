This stems from an admiration of their aesthetics - reflected in their objects, their pottery, food, gardens – and the amazing quality of their manufactured goods.</p>
<p>But what I admire most is their relentless pursuit of perfection. This is illustrated, go figure, in a quote from Tom Cruise’s movie, The Last Samurai:</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMT1r9IpIf0#t=1m44s" target="_blank">...from the moment they wake they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue...</a>”<!--more--></p>
<p>Imagine the pride that our OutSystems engineers felt when Bluememe, our master reseller in Japan, sent us copies of an OutSystems instructional book called, RE:TOOL, freshly released in the Japanese market. This was what was written in the front page:</p>

<p>When perfectionists admire what you have crafted it means that you must be doing something right. The care we take in the vision, design and engineering of OutSystems products stems from one of our culture traits that emphasizes that “relentless pursuit of perfection.” That trait is reflected in our book, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/the-small-book/">The Small Book of The Few Big Rules</a>. The seventh Big Rule is the Excel rule:</p>
