<p>In the two years since we launched our free online training page, we’ve been paying attention to feedback from our developers and community members. So we've been working behind the scenes to enhance the online training experience and make it even easier to learn OutSystems Platform.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Easy-to-Search Videos With Transcripts</h3>
<p>You've asked for it, and we listened! Everybody was having trouble searching certain topics that were hidden inside the videos. With transcripts, you no longer need to watch the whole video to find the topic that interests you. Just jump directly to it!</p>

<p>And now you can even reference a specific time frame when asking questions.</p>
