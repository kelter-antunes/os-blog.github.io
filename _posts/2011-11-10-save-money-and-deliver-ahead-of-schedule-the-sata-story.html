<p>I was excited to read a <a href="http://www.sata.pt/en/press-releases/sata-featured-international-project-managementmagazine">story in<i> PM Network</i></a> profiling our client, <a href="http://www.sata.pt/">SATA International</a>, an airline headquartered in Portugal. The article highlights how SATA - using OutSystems' <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a> - <b>built a custom airport operational management system</b> after the packaged software vendor behind their previous application came to them at renewal time presenting a significant price increase.<!--more--></p>

<div>"<a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/em/buy-or-build/">Buy vs. build</a>" is a typical issue we hear from Agile Platform users, and as the <i>PM Network</i> article points out, the answer for SATA was "build" after they realized they could <b>reduce costs</b> and improve organizational efficiency by building their own application. For SATA, the airport operational management system is a critical application that needs to be fully integrated with SATA's operational systems. And after a short experience working with OutSystems' Agile Platform, <b>SATA was certain they had the right platform</b> to build their application .</div>
<div></div>
<div>As SATA CIO Paulo Ornelas said in the PM Network article:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><i>"Even having this limited experience, the success of our first agile deployment instilled confidence that both the methodology and the technology would effectively support the project delivery."</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<p>Once SATA kicked off this project using the Agile Platform, they were able to deliver the application <b>even quicker than expected</b>. Paulo Ornealas told <i>PM Network</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><i>"We actually issued the final release a month early, with an even higher than- promised level of functionality."</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And at the end of the project, SATA's decision to build its own custom application was validated, with <b>substantial financial savings</b> over what the packaged software vendor originally quoted them for their renewal:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><i>"Financially, we were able to realize significant savings in both capital expenditure and operating expense," </i>Mr. Ornelas says. The final solution came in at only 15 percent of the total cost proposed by the vendor, and it was totally tailored to the organization.</div>
</blockquote>
