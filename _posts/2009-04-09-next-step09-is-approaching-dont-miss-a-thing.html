<p>Welcome to the OutSystems About Agility blog!</p>
<p>We decided that a good launch point for this blog would be our Annual User Group conference, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep"><b>next</b>step'09</a>, where we are bringing together Agile practitioners from across the globe to discuss all things Agile.</p>
<p>This year's event is taking place on <b>April 15 and 16 in Lisbon </b>- and since the economy has curtailed many people's travel plans, we want to keep everyone up-to-date on the conference proceedings no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>With over 300 attendees already registered, this Agile event is shaping up to be a cracker!<!--more--></p>

<p>The conference will be a unique opportunity to learn about Agile in practice - tools, techniques, best practices, case studies and the latest in Agile technology. <b>We will be blogging in real-time from the keynotes and all the tracks and sessions which are being presented by customers, partners and the OutSystems team</b>.</p>
<p>If you cannot attend the event, we're sorry to miss you in Sunny Lisbon, but hope that we can bring you some flavor of this year's <b>next</b>step'09 through our About Agility blog.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Stay tuned. More soon.</p>
