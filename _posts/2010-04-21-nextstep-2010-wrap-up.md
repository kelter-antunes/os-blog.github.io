Thanks to all the speakers for sharing their experience of using Agile methodologies and the Agile Platform in their organizations: our customers, partners, OutSystems team and our special guests.  To all who attended and participated in the breakfast roundtables, the CIO roundtable and sessions. And, last but not least, thanks to our sponsors and partners for supporting the OutSystems community.
