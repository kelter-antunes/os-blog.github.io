<div>The best way to have a great Christmas, is to help others have a better Christmas! And you don't need to spend extra money to help others... sometimes everything  you need is already available to you, it's just waiting for a bit of imagination!<!--more--></div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are 2 ideas to help others on Christmas:</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-top:15px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">1. Reallocate Budget</span></b></div>
<div></div>
<div>There's always some budget allocated for Christmas activities. For example, to print some holiday cards, to send some gifts to special partners, customers and so on. What if, instead of spending the money on a bottle of wine for your customer, you bought a gift for a kid that wasn't having a Christmas without your help? I'm sure that your customer would understand. Just handwrite him or her note explaining that Santa made a detour while getting this year's gift!  If you add up a bunch of bottles of wine you will find that you can make a lot of kids happy!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="xmas-gifts.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xmas-gifts2.png" width="538" height="438" /></span></div>
<div style="padding-top:15px;"><b><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">2. Recycle Old Hardware</span></b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Remember that old laptop you no longer use and that's taking up space in the storage room? It might be exactly what a kid needs to learn about computers and the internet. Having a computer can give a child the edge he or she needs to have a much better future, and all you have to do is clean it up, install a free operating system and deliver it! Way better than recycling! And while you're at it, why not install 10 laptops?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" alt="xmas-laptops.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xmas-laptops2.png" width="545" height="438" /></span></div>
<div>So there you have it, two simple ideas to help others for Christmas that don't cost you extra (well, we did offer lunch to the guys that installed the laptops, but it was well worth it!)</div>
<div></div>
<div>What about you? What are your ideas for helping others, without making your CFO grind his teeth?</div>
