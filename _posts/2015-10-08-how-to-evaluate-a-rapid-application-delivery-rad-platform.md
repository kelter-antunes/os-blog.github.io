Every customer is unique. After helping many customers execute successful software projects, one thing is clear - they all <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/poc-guide-rad-application-delivery/" target="_blank">follow a plan</a>. The best organizations gather the information they need internally about their resources and abilities, along with the expectations of project delivery for the near- and long-term goals. They’ll also go on a thorough fact-finding mission to gather all relevant information about low-code platform vendors to ensure their chosen platform fully supports the systems and needs of the organization.

With all that said, I’ve also seen many customers struggle with determining the right set of questions and evaluation method to use to get the results they desire. Often times, it’s the definition of a plan that enables an IT leader or team to get the process moving quickly.

Essentially there are five main components to planning a thorough request for information, proposal or quote. Of course, all criteria should meet the SMART project management acronym. They should be Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant to your organization’s needs, and Timely. Within this criteria, this kit, Rapid Application Delivery Platforms: <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/select-mobile-app-delivery-platform/" target="_blank">The Complete Evaluation</a> and <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/poc-guide-rad-application-delivery/" target="_blank">Proof of Concept Guide</a> outlines a set of steps that delivers you with a solid framework to begin the proof of concept journey.

The outline involves a dual level of planning, starting at the company-level and then moving to project-level planning. The plan has five major steps:
<ol style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Define Needs</strong> – <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/1/select-mobile-app-delivery-platform/" target="_blank">Specify Evaluation Criteria</a></li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Designate Stakeholders</strong> – Assembling the Internal Team</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Develop Use Case</strong> – Designing a Test Project</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Draft Project Plan</strong> – Building a Roadmap</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Next Steps</strong> – Proceeding to the Proof of Concept (kit includes a number of customizable documents to use to:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Evaluate platform vendors</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Determine the scope of a test project</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Strategize on best resource utilization</li>
	<li>Use the results as the starting point for RFI, RFQ and RFPs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Within each step, important considerations and criteria are offered to help IT teams discover all essential requirements needed for an enterprise level platform.

Of course within your research and internal examination process, you’ll uncover a number of criteria – some that maybe more valuable than others depending on the breadth and depth of the applications your company seeks to create. For instance, visual modeling may a critical functionality for your IT department to assist you in mapping workflows and business logic. Or maybe the requirements for a platform that allows for immediate, rapid change is more valued within your organization. Whatever the most critical factors you need in a platform – it’s safe to say that a basic overview or demonstration of each functionality is fully represented in the platform you’re considering.
