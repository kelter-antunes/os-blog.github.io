Yes, it took an entire weekend to recover from NextStep! But we're back and just wanted to wrap-up an amazing Agile conference.

First, the OutSystems team would like to thank everyone - guest speakers, customers, partners, members of the press and OutSystems employees - for coming to the conference and making it such an information rich, worthwhile and fun Agile event.<i> Thank You!!<!--more--></i>

<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/04/4-trends-driving-it-as-a-source-of-competitive-advantage.html">Paulo Rosado said that Trend #1 is that Agile Adoption</a> <i>is accelerating </i>- and this conference certainly seems to be proof of this - with all the exceptional sessions on Agile development and delivery experiences, case studies and tips and tricks!  We will be posting information on how you can access the presentation slides in the near future - in the meantime you can read our <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">blog entries on each session</a> in this blog.
