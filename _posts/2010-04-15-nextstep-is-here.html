<p>Today is the first day of OutSystems' Annual User Conference - <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep</a>. This year we have over 661 agile practitioners registered for the conference (more than doubling last year!) and they'll soon be pouring into the <a href="http://www.estorilcc.com/en/home.aspx">Estoril Congress Center</a>, in the beautiful seaside resort of Estoril - just outside Lisbon, Portugal.<!--more--></p>

<p>This morning, our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/partners">OutPartner community</a>, represented by partners from all over Europe and the US, is meeting for a quarterly InStep session.  After lunch, we're looking forward to the kick-off of NextStep by <a href="http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=9152">Massimo Pezzini</a>, VP and Gartner Fellow, and his keynote on how organizations can improve IT efficiencies in this new decade.</p>
<p>If you are unable to be with us in beautiful Portugal this week - we haven't forgotten about you! We'll be blogging and tweeting on the conference sessions, which you can follow on our <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/nextstep/">NextStep social media page</a>.</p>

<p>If you're attending the conference - we'd love to hear your thoughts - in person, on our blog or in the <a href="http://twitter.com/outsystems">twittersphere</a>!  Please share your shots of the conference on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/nextstep2010/">Flickr page</a> and don't forget to use the twitter <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23nxstep+OR+%23outsystems"><b>#nxstep</b></a> hashtag!</p>
