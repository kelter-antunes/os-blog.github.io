Today we released a new version of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform">OutSystems <b>Agile Platform - 5.0</b></a>! In this version we're <b>taking agile a step further</b>; not only are we supporting the entire application lifecycle management for web applications, we also added support for IT teams to rapidly develop <b>business processes using agile methodologies.<!--more--></b>

Traditionally, business process development was done at a different pace using different tools than IT used for application development. However, one of the biggest challenges facing the business process world is the integration of business processes <i>with </i>applications; which meant one of them was always waiting for the other.  And, in the case of our customers who already use the Agile Platform, web application development was happening faster than business processes development.

Using the new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/business-process"><b>Business Process Technology</b> </a>capabilities of the platform, IT teams can develop business processes <b>totally integrated with web applications </b>in an agile manner. All artifacts that the Agile Platform provides for Web Application development - like TrueChange technology, 1 Click-Publishing, Real Time Monitoring, and so on - are also available for business process development.

To develop this new capability, the OutSystems R&amp;D team partnered with one of our customers, <a href="http://www.vanameyde.com/">Van Ameyde</a>, to design and implement this capability. Van Ameyde uses business processes intensively for insurance claims processing and has very heavy change demands for those processes. Customer participation has been key to the development of the new 5.0 functionality, and we believe that it led to a pragmatic implementation of Business Process Technology that will allow IT teams to fulfill the needs of the business from a process perspective, as fast as they have been doing for web applications with the Agile Platform.

Along with Business Process Technology, version 5.0 includes many other improvements that will make developers a lot more productive. If you're already using the Agile Platform, <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/ViewTopic.aspx?Topic=What%27s-new-in-the-Agile-Platform-5.0">check the videos</a> of some of the improvements we made to the platform. If you want to give it a try for yourself, the best thing to do is <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/download">download the (free) Community Edition</a> and try out the new capabilities of the platform.

We had a lot of help from a lot of people, in particular from our Beta customers who provided such excellent early feedback, and a special thanks goes to the 5.0 team that delivered such a great product! Version 5.0 of the Agile Platform will definitely raise the bar for agile.  Give it a try, the 5.0 development team promises you that it ROCKS!
