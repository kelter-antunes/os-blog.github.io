<a href="http://twitter.com/mkrigsman">Michael Krigsman</a> recently asked the questions "<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/projectfailures/?p=3826">Do CEO's *really* care about IT?</a>"Â and reviewed a panel discussion by CEO's from tech companies talking about the issues of Business-IT alignment. He says, after listening to that discussion "it appears little progress has made been in addressing this issue."

I would love to have heard the discussion between CEO's of non-tech companies to see if their views differed - my guess is if they were honest they would agree with Champy that "CEOs don't pay attention to technology unless something breaks down."<!--more-->

Having said that, I have met many progressive CEO's who realize that their business can grow and thrive as a direct result of their investment in IT.

On the issue of Business-IT alignment, this is one of the fundamental reasons why we have championed Agile as a methodology for application development. It's not just the latest trend in IT, but at its very core is about solving the issue of non-alignment and its down-sides with which we are all familiar. Agile requires massive cultural change from both Business and IT - but if embraced, we have seen HUGE changes in the value delivered by IT, the on-going relationship between Business and IT, and most importantly - tangible and repeatable value delivered to aid competitiveness and growth of businesses. The p<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/next-step09/">resentations by customers and partners </a>on their Agile case studies (at our recent customer conference in Lisbon) is a testament to this potential for success.

So - yes, I second Michael's call for CEO's to publicly proclaim Business-IT integration as a strategic priority - especially if they want to stay ahead of the curve!

How well aligned is your IT with the business and is IT on your CEO's radar?
