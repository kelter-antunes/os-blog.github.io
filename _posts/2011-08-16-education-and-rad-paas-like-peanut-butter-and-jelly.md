IT professionals in the education space have a difficult task facing them - they have to meet the demands of students, teachers and administrative support staff with what typically amounts to a shoestring budget.<!--more-->

<div>In the past few years, this has meant relying heavily on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions that, while inexpensive, tend to be difficult to integrate with existing school resources and rarely meet all the needs of a district. On the other hand, custom-developed applications can meet all of a school IT administrator's needs but are something of a pipe dream, thanks to the personnel, budget and equipment requirements.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is all changing, however, thanks to the cloud and, in particular, rapid application development (RAD) Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) - a category which is defined by the flexibility and power of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">Agile Platform</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For an example, take Faith Academy. A private school with brick-and-mortar locations as well as a virtual curriculum, Faith's vice president of IT, Dan Stueck, was faced with having to upgrade several important applications with a very small budget. Rather than turning to SaaS, Dan <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/case-studies/Faith%20Educational%20Ministries/Student%20Information%20System/">went with the Agile Platform</a>, leading to a highly effective partnership in the cloud.

<div>Our own Mike Jones also offered up his take on RAD PaaS in schools at <a href="http://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/interview-mike-jones-moving-schools-from-monolithic-to-customized-cloud-based/">EdTech Digest</a> - check out Mike's Q&amp;A for great insights into what schools can expect from the cloud in the future and why custom app dev is the future when it comes to school IT.</div>
