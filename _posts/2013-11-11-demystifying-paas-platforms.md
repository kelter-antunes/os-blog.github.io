Attending as many conferences as I do, and after hundreds of conversations regarding our platform as a service (PaaS) offering, it is clear that while there is a lot of interest in cloud computing, there is also a lot of confusion over what PaaS is and is not, and over the growing number of options for application development and delivery in the cloud.

Our guest speakers will discuss what drives PaaS adoption, take the mystery out of the various platform options, discuss the tremendous efficiency gains that can be achieved using high-productivity PaaS, and reveal how FICO is using the OutSystems Platform to build and deliver a wide range of decision management applications to its client base.

Our hope is that this webinar can alleviate some confusion and add value to the PaaS conversation. Last month, InfoWorld published a piece stating that <a title="Most new IT spending will be in the cloud" href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/2016-most-new-it-spending-will-be-in-the-cloud-229660" target="_blank">by 2016 most new IT spending will be in the cloud</a>. It was just one of dozens of articles published recently that discuss the state of the PaaS market and implications for enterprise application development.

Considering the rapid growth in <a title="IT Spending Predicted" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2013/09/04/predicting-enterprise-cloud-computing-growth/" target="_blank">spending predicted</a> for this new, future state of IT, the discussion is certainly warranted, and we thought a little more context might be helpful. After all, OutSystems is a PaaS company, and under the platform as a service umbrella, there are a now a multitude of new options for application development and delivery (AD&amp;D). How do you distinguish which type of PaaS solution best fits your AD&amp;D needs? Hopefully this webinar will help demystify the market.
