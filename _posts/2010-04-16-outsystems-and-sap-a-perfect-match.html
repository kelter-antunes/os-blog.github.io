<div>Hugo Matthioli of Reditus spoke this afternoon on OutSystems &amp; SAP complementary solutions. He discussed the strengths of combining the two products and methodologies and how to combine them to extend base ERP functionality into the Intranet of RPA - Rui Pena, Arnaut &amp; Associados, a leading Portuguese law firm. Reditus orchestrates the delivery through its custom development and SAP implementation businesses, offering powerful combined solutions to its customers.<!--more--></div>
<div>First, he explained the challenge for RPA and his team: to deliver a rich intranet application to support document management and enterprise workflows in 4 months, by extending the existing SAP Financials, SCM and Human Capital Management implementation.</div>

At the end, the solution integrated 13 SAP web services to support 17 custom business processes.</p>
<div>Additionally, Hugo explained how to integrate an custom development project using the Agile Platform with an SAP deployment and customization project: by embracing two tracks of development with OutSystems agile methods and SAP's ASAP methodology, iterating the user'sÂ interface and stand-alone modules using OutSystems, and focusing later down the road on the SAP integration. That gives the team the required time to bring together the user interface with data integration.</div>
<div>Hugo also introduced Carlos Coelho, CFO at RPA who explained why his business required a tailored solution: custom requirements, enterprise-wide workflows and better management of business performance. "In 4 months we did more than we did in 2 years before having OutSystems and SAP!", he concluded.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Summing up his views, Hugo concluded that OutSystems and SAP have a perfect match when it comes to deploy a new business process, or extend a new one that requires leveraging existing SAP data or process into richer and integrated portals.</div>
