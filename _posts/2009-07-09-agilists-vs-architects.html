<p>Miguel and I were recently discussing an interesting presentation by Martin Fowler and Rebecca Parsons on engaging the Architecture team into your Agile methodology.  The presentation is titled "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/agilists-and-architects">Agilists and Architects: Allies not Adversaries</a>" and the summary points out that "As Agile becomes more accepted, concerns from architecture groups are increasing. Traditional ways that architects engage with development groups conflict with Agile methods."<!--more--><br />

With architecture being a core component of the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile/Solution.aspx?FolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/ITSolutions/AgileMethodology">OutSystems approach to Agile</a> application development and the role of Delivery Manager, we thought it would be interesting to share this presentation and ask the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/NetworkForums/Forum_View.aspx?ForumId=29&amp;ForumName=Agile+Methodology">OutSystems Community</a> how you have embraced architecture while practicing Agile in an Enterprise setting.</p>
<p>For example, many of you are successfully delivering a high degree of reuse while focusing on delivering individual applications.  While OutSystems' Agile Platform provides a solid foundation for refactoring code and adjusting architecture in progress, we suspect that there are many instances where your Corporate Architecture team needed to play a role in moving the application delivery forward.</p>
<p>So, if you are a Delivery Manager or Architect it is time to share your experiences of working together in an Agile application development project.  How much education was required?  Did you feel resistance? What were the lessons learned?</p>
