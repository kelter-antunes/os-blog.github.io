Earlier this week <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/test-center/archive">InfoWorld</a> delivered its <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297">findings</a> after reviewing multiple web development tools.  They looked across five key areas to compile the score; Ease of Development, Extensibility, Portability, Documentation and Value.  The products reviewed were Alpha Five Version 10, Iron Speed Designer 6.2.1, Visual LANSA for the Web 11.5, OutSystems Agile Platform 5.0, and MLstate OPA S2 Beta.<!--more-->

Needless to say I was very happy (but not really surprised) to see that the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297?page=0,4">Agile Platform's</a> Service Studio performed top of class.

<i>Everyone who is a fan of the Agile Platform please take a minute to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/infoworld-review-tools-rapid-web-development-297#talkback">go and share your experience</a> with the InfoWorld readers!</i>
