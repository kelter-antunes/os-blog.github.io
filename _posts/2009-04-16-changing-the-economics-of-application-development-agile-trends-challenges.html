<p>Mike Jones and Carlos Alves of OutSystems got the audience's brains thinking with a discussion on "Changing The economics of Application Development" with a set of questions:</p>
<p>"<em>Can a company really innovate in today's economic environment?</em>"</p>
<p>- they think "yes", and gave examples of how new ideas are coming up from the business, they are small but they are making a significant difference to business success - however, they may need custom built software (not packages) due to the need for speed and flexibility.</p>

<p>- the guys argued that NOW is the right time to innovate and get Agile. They challenged IT teams to be ready for whatever comes next with the economy -and suggested that the only way for the Audience and their businesses to not only survive but thrive, is to get more Agile.</p>
<p>"<em>WTBWITD</em>?"</p>
<p>- Mike joked with the audience that this wasn't really easy to pronounce and needed some marketing spin - but "What The Business Wants IT Delivers" Carlos said, is the essence of Agile which is basically "a systematic approach to accommodate innovation</p>
<p>"<em>What is Lean?</em>"</p>
<p>- the process to making sure IT delivers what the business needs - Agile is the secret to becoming Lean.</p>
<p>"<em>What is Agile and how is OutSystems different?</em>"</p>
<p>-Industry agile projects: iterative development with 4-6 week sprints, continuous business participation and deliver vertically integrated solutions at the end of each sprint.</p>
<p>-The OutSystems Agile Approach: able to pre-size the project with high accuracy; time-box principle, smaller up-front analysis and more prototyping; 2 week sprints that deliver vertically integrated solutions at the end of EACH DAY. Leverage SCRUM practices.</p>
<p>A great question came from the audience about "<em>how to become MORE agile when your team is on the other side of the world and difficult to reach"</em>- they are doing 3 month sprints...which is not Agile, its waterfall.</p>
<p>- Answers from the OutSystems team: The first issue is likely to be the lack of commitment from the business side to attend the regular weekly sprints. The second is that they need to have a business sponsor with authority who attends the regular sprints. Final suggestion - to ensure that an Engagement manager is local to the business-team, and that the Delivery Manager and the Engagement Manager are in constant communication.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, Mike and Carlos challenged the audience on "<em>What role will you play in today's economy?"</em></p>
<p>- You have two choices: put your head in your hands and hope it all goes away or take the opportunity to embrace change and innovate."</p>
<p>Wise words that we can probably apply to all our lives in these uncertain times.</p>
