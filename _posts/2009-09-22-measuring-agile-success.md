Last month our company announced its new <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Content.aspx?ContentName=agilityaward-Jul09-PR&amp;FolderPath=%2fRoot%2fContents%2fCorporate%2fLandingPages%2fNews%2fagilityaward-Jul09-PR">Agility Awards</a> - and the first set of awards were presented for <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Customer.aspx?FolderId=4724&amp;ParentFolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/Customers&amp;SectionName=Customers"> five Agile projects</a> that had been completed by customers and partners using  OutSystems' Agile Platform and employing Agile methodology.

The question I want to pose is what are good criteria for assessing a successful Agile project? This question builds on Mike's recent post about <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/blog/aboutagility/2009/08/whats-a-good-measure-of-an-agile-project-managers-success.html#comments">criteria for measuring an Agile project manager's success</a> - and we got lots of great responses and ideas in the comments. <!--more-->

The data points being used by the OutSystems team to evaluate whether projects are eligible for an award are:
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 1em;">1.    Size &amp; scope of project: the project should be of medium to large scale (over 40,000 software units in size.)</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">2.    Project definition &amp; objectives: the project should deliver significant and measurable business value.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">3.    Project approach: the project should have been run based on Agile practices, following an iterative development approach with regular end user involvement.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em;">4.    Project metrics: a baseline of project metrics must be submitted in order to measure the impact of using Agile to deliver the application.</span></blockquote>
The team then use these data points to assess whether an Agile approach was employed to deliver the project on time, on budget, with 100% user adoption and delivered true value to the business and IT.

<b><i>Is this list a reasonable set of data points for measuring the success of an agile project? </i></b>
BTW - Here are some examples of the results from the initial set of award winners (read more details <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/Customer.aspx?FolderId=4724&amp;ParentFolderPath=/Root/Contents/Corporate/Customers&amp;SectionName=Customers">here</a>):
