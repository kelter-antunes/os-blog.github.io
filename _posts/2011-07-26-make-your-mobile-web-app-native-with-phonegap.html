<p>Building a <b>Mobile Web Application</b> is the fastest way to get a mobile app in the hands of your users. You get to build an app at a fraction of the cost of building native, it works on multiple devices from day one, and you don't need to go through the appstore publishing process (if you want to find out why Mobile Web Applications are the way to go, check this <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/offer/mobile/kick-start-your-mobile-apps-ebook/">free eBook</a>).</p>
<div><!--more--></div>
<div>But sometimes Mobile Web Applications just don't cut it... you either need to access a specific features of the mobile device - like the camera or address book - or you really want to get your app in the appstore. If that's the case, <b>Hybrid Applications</b> are a great solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In this video, we show you how to build such a Hybrid Application using the <a href="http://www.outsystems.com/agile-platform/">OutSystems Platform</a> to build the Mobile Web Application, and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> to create a native shell on top of your Web Application.</div>
