It’s not unusual for a company to have a love/hate relationship with mobile apps. Business users love the prospect of having another revenue generator and means of engagement, but nobody - especially IT - likes lengthening development queues and facing talent shortages. And, let’s be honest that’s exactly what mobile app developers in the enterprise are experiencing.<!--more-->

According to research by Opinion Matters, <strong>85% of organizations surveyed have a mobile backlog of between one and 20 applications</strong>. Meanwhile, the demands on development teams are increasing while the skills required to deliver on those demands are becoming harder to come by – 92% of respondents said developer vacancies constituted between 11% and 50% of their current team size.

Disgruntled developers are just the beginning when a company can’t deliver on its mobile app initiatives. Companies also risk losing potential revenue streams, competitive differentiators and potential efficiency gains from mobile employees. Fortunately, enterprises can reduce these risks by:
<ul>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Automating</strong> - Understand where and when to automate to make the entire application lifecycle more efficient. Outsourcing – Carefully identify and outsource the low-level, low-value tasks that won’t put the organization at risk of being overly dependent on third-party relationships.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Staff training</strong> - Ensure that staff members have the development skills needed to keep up with business demands.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Developing once</strong> - Develop a multi-channel mobile app development strategy that enables your team to develop an app once for all devices.</li>
	<li><strong>Creating change maintenance</strong> - These processes enable developers to easily and efficiently update mobile apps with new features and functionality.</li>
</ul>
Companies face a number of challenges when it comes to delivering mobile apps, but by focusing on and optimizing available resources they can be overcome.
