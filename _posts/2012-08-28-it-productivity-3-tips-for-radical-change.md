<div align="left">As I talk to different IT managers and their teams about how they go about application development when building custom software I am always amazed by the excuses as to why their team cannot change. They range from compliance and regulatory issues, lack of time to learn a new technology and everything in between.</div>

<div align="left">The frustrating part is that in practice the three things I keep harping on actually work very well and can lead to radical productivity improvements. <b> What is holding back CIOs and their teams from really investing in making changes that can dramatically improve the way they perform?</b> Share your opinion in the comments below.</div>

<div align="left">If you want to know the <b>three productivity enhancers</b> I always recommend to enterprise IT shops check out the<b> IT Productivity Webinar Series</b> just wrapped up by the team at OutSystems (along with some industry insiders) below. I doubt you will be surprised by the topics:
<ol>
	<li style="padding-bottom:15px;"><span style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Tools</b></span>: Leverage a development platform that lets you build, change and deliver with amazing speed and quality. This webinar was given by John Rymer, industry analyst at Forrester, based on research report published at the end of 2011 titled '<i>The New Productivity Platforms: Your Solution to the AD&amp;D Crunch</i>'.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom:15px;"><span style="font-size: 1em;padding-bottom:15px;"><b>Methods</b></span>: No matter how good your tools are, if you build the wrong system you are doomed to failure. Thus, I advise embracing an Agile approach and start delivering in small iterations. This webinar shared 9 rules for doing agile in the enterprise. Dave Thomas, agile evangelists and founding director of the Agile Alliance provided insight and comments on our rules to keep us honest.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Process</b></span>: Once you start to embrace Agile and have the tools that let you deliver fast and often you will have to overcome a final hurdle - streamlining the handoffs between your development and operations teams. In this final webinar we shared <b>5 tips to overcoming releasephobia and streamlining your DevOps processes</b>.</li>
