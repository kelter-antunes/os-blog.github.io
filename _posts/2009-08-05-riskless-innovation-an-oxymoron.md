There seems to have been a burst of discussion on <i>risk </i>lately.  <a href="http://www.paulorosado.com/2009/07/risk-reward-and-agile.html">Paulo Rosado's blog</a> got me thinking on this topic and led me to the following question - Can you innovate without taking any risk?  The obvious answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Innovation is all about doing something different, better, in a way not previously thought of, etc.  In the end, innovating is always risky.  But we also know it is important and valuable.  So how do you take the plunge and innovate while minimizing risk in application development?<!--more-->

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" alt="bungee-small.jpg" src="http://54.209.0.237/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bungee-small.jpg" width="200" height="251" /></span>Let's focus the discussion on building new application software in Corporate IT shops.  It has always been risky to do custom development and for the last 15 years or so we have tried to minimize the risk by purchasing packages.  The general premise is that "someone else must know how to do things better than we do so let's purchase their software."  While packages play an important role in most Enterprise application portfolios we all know that they have been more expensive and riskier than we originally thought.  Plus, the more popular the package the more bloated it has become resulting in higher costs and complex configuration efforts.

In hindsight we see that there have been companies who bucked the package trend and emerged as huge winners.  Some of the obvious ones include Amazon, eBay, ING and Google.  But I personally don't think these companies and their innovative applications align with the types of new applications being purchased or built in most Enterprise IT shops.  The applications I see most often are trying to automate some business process like customer relationship management, partner management portals, call center applications, etc.  For many, a new packaged application will suffice but we also see that in many cases a package is overkill.  So, the dilemma is how do I meet my business needs while avoiding the cost and risk associated with trying to make a package fit?  Starting to sound innovative and risky???

So how do you embrace innovation in your business when it comes to delivering these new business applications while minimizing risk?  You're reading the About Agility blog so you've probably guessed what I'm going to say...apply Agile methodology to your application development process.  How does Agile help you innovate and reduce risk?  Well, by taking an iterative approach to development and getting continuous input from the business people on the ground (whom we have found to be the source of most innovative ideas,) as you progress the application you will incorporate more innovative ideas and never get too far off track before getting a taste of reality.  In this way you will deliver a leaner solution that only delivers what the business needs and is likely to solve business problems in new and innovative ways.

So go Agile and start innovating!  Share your experiences in applying agile application development to deliver innovative applications!
