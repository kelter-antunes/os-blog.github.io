<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/business/23blood.html">New York Times</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703876404575199931699094978.html">Wall Street Journal</a> recently ran  articles on an important new blood test, called <a href="http://www.xdx.com/allomap/">AlloMap</a>, which was developed by <a href="http://www.xdx.com/">XDx</a>, a cutting-edge biopharma based in California. <!--more--><img class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px;" alt="xdxAlloMap.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xdxAlloMap2.jpg" width="217" height="172" />What's AlloMap, and why is it making headlines? From the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/business/23blood.html">article</a>:</p>
<p>A blood test that analyzes genetic activity could let heart transplant patients avoid many of the invasive and uncomfortable biopsies now used to monitor whether their immune systems are rejecting their new organs, doctors said in a study published Thursday.</p>
<p>The study found that patients who were monitored for rejection using the blood test had outcomes roughly equivalent to those of patients who were given frequent heart biopsies.</p>
<p>It's an impressive development in the area of cardiovascular medicine, and according to one doctor quoted in the article, XDx's AlloMap "will cause a paradigm shift in how we monitor for rejection."</p>
<p><i>So what does this have to do with agile development or OutSystems?</i></p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">XDx used the OutSystems Agile Platform to create the business application it now uses to track and analyze the diagnostic tests required in clinical studies. The application replaced XDx's former Excel-based and manually intensive processes, increasing their ability to study clinical data in a timely manner. Using Agile Platform, XDx delivered its first application to business users in only 6 weeks - including one week of fine-tuning. XDx's story is only one example of the kind of applications that are being built using Agile Platform, but we think it's a pretty remarkable one.</p>
